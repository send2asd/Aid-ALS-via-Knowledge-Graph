Most ALS cases are sporadic but approximately 10% of ALS cases are due to inherited mutations in identified genes. ALS-causing mutations were identified in over 30 genes with superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), fused in sarcoma (FUS), and TAR DNA-binding protein (TARDBP, encoding TDP-43) being the most frequent. In the last few decades, Drosophila melanogaster emerged as a versatile model for studying neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. In this review, we describe the different Drosophila ALS models that have been successfully used to decipher the cellular and molecular pathways associated with SOD1, C9orf72, FUS, and TDP-43. The study of the known fruit fly orthologs of these ALS-related genes yielded significant insights into cellular mechanisms and physiological functions. Moreover, genetic screening in tissue-specific gain-of-function mutants that mimic ALS-associated phenotypes identified disease-modifying genes. Here, we propose a comprehensive review on the Drosophila research focused on four ALS-linked genes that has revealed novel pathogenic mechanisms and identified potential therapeutic targets for future therapy.","['superoxide dismutase-1', 'SOD1', 'TAR DNA-binding protein', 'TDP-43', 'SOD1', 'TDP-43']",[],"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS']"

NRF2 activity is regulated at several levels, including protein degradation by the proteasome, transcription, and post-transcription. The purpose of this review is to offer a concise and critical overview of the main mechanisms of NRF2 regulation and their actual or potential use as targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.","['NRF2', 'NRF2', 'NRF2', 'NRF2']",[],"['Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurodegenerative diseases']"

These ALS-associated proteins are not orthologs of yeast prion proteins, but are similar in having long, intrinsically disordered domains that are rich in hydrophilic amino acids. These so-called prion-like domains are particularly aggregation-prone and are hypothesized to participate in the mislocalization and misfolding processes that occur in the motor neurons of ALS patients. Methods developed for characterizing yeast prions have been adapted to studying ALS-linked proteins containing prion-like domains. These yeast models have yielded major discoveries, including identification of new ALS genetic risk factors, new ALS-causing gene mutations and insights into how disease mutations enhance protein aggregation.",[],[],"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS']"

A combination of both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration ultimately leads to respiratory failure, similar to other dementia-type neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this paper is to pioneer current ALS research by carrying out a narrative literature review of the current treatment modalities of the disease. Through these efforts, we hope to condense the most pertinent information regarding current treatments and enhance the management of ALS patients as a whole, giving these patients a better quality of life as the search for a cure continues. We used a Pubmed search strategy and specific MeSH terms for the selection of the literature articles using the keywords ""ALS,"" ""new treatment,"" ""treatment,"" and ""symptomatic treatment."" A combination of pharmaceutical interventions, psychological support, and physical rehabilitation has been most effective in enhancing the quality of life of patients with ALS (PALS). Among potential pharmacological therapies, only a few have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration(FDA) to be used to treat ALS and its symptoms.

31133804,Front Cell Neurosci,"['Jones MK', 'Nair A', 'Gupta M']",Mast Cells in Neurodegenerative Disease.,"Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide, yet there are currently no effective treatments. Because risk of neurodegenerative disease substantially increases with age, greater life expectancy with a concomitant aging population means more individuals will be affected in the coming decades. Thus, there is an urgent need for understanding the mechanisms driving neurodegenerative diseases in order to develop improved treatment strategies. Inflammation in the nervous system, termed ""neuroinflammation,"" has become increasingly recognized as being associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Early attention focused primarily on morphological changes in astrocytes and microglia; however, brain and CNS resident mast cells are now receiving attention as a result of being ""first responders"" to injury. Mast cells also exert profound effects on their microenvironment and neighboring cells including behavior and/or activation of astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, which, in turn, are implicated in neuroinflammation, neurogenesis and neurodegeneration. Mast cells also affect disruption/permeability of the blood brain barrier enabling toxin and immune cell entry exacerbating an inflammatory microenvironment. Here, we discuss the roles of mast cells in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration with a focus on development and progression of four prominent neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington's Disease.",[],[],"['Neurodegenerative Disease', 'Neurodegenerative diseases', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'Inflammation in the nervous system', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurodegeneration', 'inflammatory', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurodegeneration', 'neurodegenerative diseases', ""Alzheimer's Disease"", ""Parkinson's Disease"", 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', ""Huntington's Disease""]"

Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyolotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) are some of the most frequent neurodegenerative diseases. Despite their diversity, these diseases share some common pathophysiological mechanisms: the abnormal aggregation of disease-related misfolded proteins, autophagosome-lysosome pathway dysregulation, impaired ubiquitin-proteasome system, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive neuroinflammation. There is still no effective drug that could halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and the current treatments are mainly symptomatic. In this regard, the development of novel multi-target pharmaceutical approaches presents an attractive therapeutic strategy. Ibudilast, an anti-inflammatory drug firstly developed as an asthma treatment, is a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) inhibitor, which mainly acts by increasing the amount of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), while downregulating the pro-inflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4). The preclinical evidence shows that ibudilast may act neuroprotectively in neurodegenerative diseases, by suppressing neuroinflammation, inhibiting apoptosis, regulating the mitochondrial function and by affecting the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagosome-lysosome pathways, as well as by attenuating oxidative stress. The clinical trials in ALS and progressive MS also show some promising results. Herein, we aim to provide an update on the emerging preclinical and clinical evidence on the therapeutic potential of ibudilast in these disorders, discuss the potential challenges and suggest the future directions.","['Phosphodiesterase (PDE', 'tumor necrosis factor-alpha', 'TNF-alpha', 'macrophage migration inhibitory factor', 'MIF', 'Toll-like receptor 4', 'TLR-4']","['Ibudilast', 'Ibudilast', 'cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'cAMP', 'cyclic guanosine monophosphate', 'cGMP', 'ibudilast', 'ibudilast']","['Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Neurodegenerative diseases', 'central nervous system disorders', 'neuronal degeneration', ""Alzheimer's disease"", ""Parkinson's disease"", 'amyolotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'multiple sclerosis', 'MS', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'inflammatory', 'asthma', 'inflammatory', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'neuroinflammation', 'ALS', 'MS']"

Due to brain tissue being not easy to acquire, the study of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders has many limitations-lack of reliable early biomarkers and personalized treatment. At the same time, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits most of the drug molecules into the damaged areas of the brain, which makes a big drop in the effect of drug treatment. Exosomes, a kind of endogenous nanoscale vesicles, play a key role in cell signaling through the transmission of genetic information and proteins between cells. Because of the ability to cross the BBB, exosomes are expected to link peripheral changes to central nervous system (CNS) events as potential biomarkers, and can even be used as a therapeutic carrier to deliver molecules specifically to CNS. Here we summarize the role of exosomes in pathophysiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of some neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).",[],[],"['Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Neurodegenerative diseases', 'neurodegenerative disorders', 'neurodegenerative diseases', ""Alzheimer's Disease"", ""Parkinson's Disease"", ""Huntington's Disease"", 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis']"

Therapeutic efficacy is therefore dependent on knowledge of the disease pathogenesis and the required temporal and spatial specificity of gene expression. An additional critical challenge is achieving the most complete transduction of the target structure while avoiding leakage into neighboring regions or perivascular spaces. The gene therapy field has recently entered a new technological era, in which interventional MRI-guided convection-enhanced delivery (iMRI-CED) is the gold standard for verifying accurate vector delivery in real time. The availability of this advanced neurosurgical technique may accelerate the translation of the promising preclinical therapeutics under development for neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's diseases.",[],[],"['Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'neurodegenerative disorders', ""Parkinson's"", ""Huntington's"", ""Alzheimer's diseases""]"

These condensates allow for rapid cellular responses to changes in metabolic activities and signaling. Nowhere is this regulation more important than in neurons and glia, where cellular physiology occurs simultaneously on a range of time- and length-scales. In a number of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), misregulation of biomolecular condensates leads to the formation of insoluble aggregates-a pathological hallmark of both sporadic and familial ALS. Here, we summarize how the emerging knowledge about the LLPS of ALS-related proteins corroborates with their aggregation.

31724708,Brain,"['Moll T', 'Shaw PJ', 'Cooper-Knock J']",Disrupted glycosylation of lipids and proteins is a cause of neurodegeneration.,"Glycosyltransferases represent a large family of enzymes that catalyse the biosynthesis of oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates. A number of studies have implicated glycosyltransferases in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases but differentiating cause from effect has been difficult. We have recently discovered that mutations proximal to the substrate binding site of glycosyltransferase 8 domain containing 1 (GLT8D1) are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We demonstrated that ALS-associated mutations reduce activity of the enzyme suggesting a loss-of-function mechanism that is an attractive therapeutic target. Our work is the first evidence that isolated dysfunction of a glycosyltransferase is sufficient to cause a neurodegenerative disease, but connection between neurodegeneration and genetic variation within glycosyltransferases is not new. Previous studies have identified associations between mutations in UGT8 and sporadic ALS, and between ST6GAL1 mutations and conversion of mild cognitive impairment into clinical Alzheimer's disease. In this review we consider potential mechanisms connecting glycosyltransferase dysfunction to neurodegeneration. The most prominent candidates are ganglioside synthesis and impaired addition of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) groups to proteins important for axonal and synaptic function. Special consideration is given to examples where genetic mutations within glycosyltransferases are associated with neurodegeneration in recognition of the fact that these changes are likely to be upstream causes present from birth.","['glycosyltransferase 8 domain containing 1', 'GLT8D1', 'UGT8', 'ST6GAL1', 'O-GlcNAc']","['lipids', 'oligosaccharides', 'polysaccharides', 'ganglioside', 'O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine']","['neurodegeneration', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'neurodegeneration', 'ALS', 'cognitive impairment', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'neurodegeneration', 'neurodegeneration']"

Although novel ALS genetic variants have been identified, the shared genetic risk between ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders remains poorly understood. Objectives: To examine whether there are common genetic variants that determine the risk for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases and to identify their functional pathways. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this study conducted from December 1, 2016, to August 1, 2017, the genetic overlap between ALS, sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD), FTD with TDP-43 inclusions, Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) were systematically investigated in 124 876 cases and controls. No participants were excluded from this study. Diagnoses were established using consensus criteria. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were a list of novel loci and their functional pathways in ALS, FTD, PSP, and ALS mouse models. Results: Among 124 876 cases and controls, genome-wide conjunction analyses of ALS, FTD, PD, AD, CBD, and PSP revealed significant genetic overlap between ALS and FTD at known ALS loci: rs13302855 and rs3849942 (nearest gene, C9orf72; P = .03 for rs13302855 and P = .005 for rs3849942) and rs4239633 (nearest gene, UNC13A; P = .03). Significant genetic overlap was also found between ALS and PSP at rs7224296, which tags the MAPT H1 haplotype (nearest gene, NSF; P = .045). Shared risk genes were enriched for pathways involving neuronal function and development. At a conditional FDR P < .05, 22 novel ALS polymorphisms were found, including rs538622 (nearest gene, ERGIC1; P = .03 for ALS and FTD), which modifies BNIP1 expression in human brains (35 of 137 females; mean age, 59 years; P = .001). BNIP1 expression was significantly reduced in spinal cord motor neurons from patients with ALS (4 controls: mean age, 60.5 years, mean [SE] value, 3984 [760.8] arbitrary units [AU]; 7 patients with ALS: mean age, 56 years, mean [SE] value, 1999 [274.1] AU; P = .02), in an ALS mouse model (mean [SE] value, 13.75 [0.09] AU for 2 SOD1 WT mice and 11.45 [0.03] AU for 2 SOD1 G93A mice; P = .002) and in brains of patients with PSP (80 controls: 39 females; mean age, 82 years, mean [SE] value, 6.8 [0.2] AU; 84 patients with PSP: 33 females, mean age 74 years, mean [SE] value, 6.8 [0.1] AU; beta = -0.19; P = .009) or FTD (11 controls: 4 females; mean age, 67 years; mean [SE] value, 6.74 [0.05] AU; 17 patients with FTD: 10 females; mean age, 69 years; mean [SE] value, 6.53 [0.04] AU; P = .005). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found novel genetic overlap between ALS and diseases of the FTD spectrum, that the MAPT H1 haplotype confers risk for ALS, and identified the mitophagy-associated, proapoptotic protein BNIP1 as an ALS risk gene. Together, these findings suggest that sporadic ALS may represent a selectively pleiotropic, polygenic disorder.","['TDP-43', 'C9orf72', 'UNC13A', 'MAPT', 'NSF', 'ERGIC1', 'BNIP1', 'BNIP1', 'SOD1', 'SOD1', 'MAPT', 'BNIP1']",[],"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Diseases of the', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'neurodegenerative disorder', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'neurodegenerative disorders', 'ALS', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'ALS', 'sporadic frontotemporal dementia', 'FTD', 'FTD', 'Parkinson disease', 'PD', 'Alzheimer disease', 'AD', 'corticobasal degeneration', 'CBD', 'progressive supranuclear palsy', 'PSP', 'ALS', 'FTD', 'PSP', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'FTD', 'PD', 'AD', 'CBD', 'PSP', 'ALS', 'FTD', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'PSP', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'FTD', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'PSP', 'PSP', 'FTD', 'FTD', 'ALS', 'diseases of the', 'FTD', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'sporadic ALS']"

33706937,Adv Pharmacol,['Wang JKT'],Uniting homeostatic plasticity and exosome biology: A revision of the conceptual framework for drug discovery in neurodegenerative diseases?,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are in need of new drug discovery approaches. Our previous systematic analyses of Huntington's Disease (HD) literature for protein-protein interactors (PPIs) and modifiers of mutant Huntingtin-driven phenotypes revealed enrichment for PPIs of genes required for homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) and exosome (EV) function and exosomal proteins, which in turn highly overlapped each other and with PPIs of genes associated with other NDDs. We proposed that HSP and EVs are linked to each other and are also involved in NDD pathophysiology. Recent studies showed that HSP is indeed altered in HD and AD, and that presynaptic homeostatic plasticity in motoneurons compensates for ALS pathology. Eliminating it causes earlier degeneration and death. If this holds true in other NDDs, drug discovery in animal models should then include elucidation of homeostatic compensation that either masks phenotypes of physiologically expressed mutant genes or are overridden by their overexpression. In this new conceptual framework, enhancing such underlying homeostatic compensation forms the basis for novel therapeutic strategies to slow progression of NDDs. Moreover, if EVs are linked to HSP, then their ability to penetrate the brain, target cell types, deliver miRNA and other molecules can be leveraged to develop attractive drug modalities. Testing this new framework is posed as four questions on model development and mechanistic studies progressing from higher throughput platforms to mouse models. Similar approaches may apply to other CNS disorders including schizophrenia, autism, Rett and Fragile X syndromes due to potential links of their susceptibility genes to HSP and EVs.",['Huntingtin'],[],"['neurodegenerative diseases', 'Neurodegenerative diseases', 'NDDs', ""Huntington's Disease"", 'HD', 'NDDs', 'NDD', 'HD', 'AD', 'ALS', 'death', 'NDDs', 'NDDs', 'CNS disorders', 'schizophrenia', 'autism', 'Rett', 'Fragile X syndromes']"

Structural variants within the genome can play a significant role in neurodegenerative disease risk, such as the repeat expansion in C9orf72 and the tri-nucleotide repeat in ATXN2, both of which are associated with familial and sporadic ALS. Many such structural variants reside in uncharacterized regions of the human genome, and have been under studied. Therefore, characterization of structural variants located in and around genes associated with ALS could provide insight into disease pathogenesis, and lead to the discovery of highly informative genetic tools for stratification in clinical trials. Such genomic variants may provide a deeper understanding of how gene expression can affect disease etiology, disease severity and trajectory, patient response to treatment, and may hold the key to understanding the genetics of sporadic ALS. This article outlines the current understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genetics and how structural variations may underpin some of the missing heritability of this disease.","['C9orf72', 'ATXN2']",[],"['sALS', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis']"

It is generally characterized by progressive paralysis starting at the limbs ultimately leading to death caused by respiratory failure. There is no cure and current treatments fail to slow the progression of the disease. As such, new treatment options are desperately needed. Epigenetic targets are an attractive possibility because they are reversible. Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression unrelated to changes in DNA sequence. Three main epigenetic mechanisms include the methylation of DNA, microRNAs and the post-translational modification of histone proteins. Histone modifications occur in many amino acid residues and include phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation as well as other chemical moieties. Recent evidence points to a possible role for epigenetic mechanisms in the etiology of ALS. Here, we review recent advances linking ALS and epigenetics, with a strong focus on histone modifications.

Few HERVs retain some coding capability. Sometimes, the host has the advantage of some HERV genes; conversely, HERVs may contribute to pathogenesis. The expression of HERVs depends on several factors, and is regulated epigenetically by stimuli such as inflammation, viral and microbial infections, etc. Increased expression of HERVs occurs in physiological and pathological conditions, in one or more body sites. Several diseases have been attributed to one or more HERVs, particularly neurological diseases. The key problem is to differentiate the expression of a HERV as cause or effect of a disease. To be used as a biomarker, a correlation between the expression of a certain HERV and the disease onset and/or behavior must be found. The greater challenge is to establish a pathogenic role. The criteria defining causal connections between HERVs and diseases include the development of animal models, and disease modulation in humans, by anti-HERV therapeutic antibody. So far, statistically significant correlations between HERVs and diseases have been achieved for HERV-W and multiple sclerosis; disease reproduction in transgenic animals was achieved for HERV-W and multiple sclerosis, and for HERV-K and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Infection with enteroviruses, including poliovirus and coxsackievirus, such as coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), has been proposed as a possible causal/risk factor for ALS due to the evidence that enteroviruses can target motor neurons and establish a persistent infection in the central nervous system (CNS), and recent findings that enteroviral infection-induced molecular and pathological phenotypes closely resemble ALS. However, a causal relationship has not yet been affirmed. METHODS: Wild-type C57BL/6J and G85R mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1G85R) ALS mice were intracerebroventricularly infected with a sublethal dose of CVB3 or sham-infected. For a subset of mice, ribavirin (a broad-spectrum anti-RNA viral drug) was given subcutaneously during the acute or chronic stage of infection. Following viral infection, general activity and survival were monitored daily for up to week 60. Starting at week 20 post-infection (PI), motor functions were measured weekly. Mouse brains and/or spinal cords were harvested at day 10, week 20 and week 60 PI for histopathological evaluation of neurotoxicity, immunohistochemical staining of viral protein, neuroinflammatory/immune and ALS pathology markers, and NanoString and RT-qPCR analysis of inflammatory gene expression. RESULTS: We found that sublethal infection (mimicking chronic infection) of SOD1G85R ALS mice with CVB3 resulted in early onset and progressive motor dysfunction, and shortened lifespan, while similar viral infection in C57BL/6J, the background strain of SOD1G85R mice, did not significantly affect motor function and mortality as compared to mock infection within the timeframe of the current study (60 weeks PI). Furthermore, we showed that CVB3 infection led to a significant increase in proinflammatory gene expression and immune cell infiltration and induced ALS-related pathologies (i.e., TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology and neuronal damage) in the CNS of both SOD1G85R and C57BL/6J mice. Finally, we discovered that early (day 1) but not late (day 15) administration of ribavirin could rescue ALS-like neuropathology and symptoms induced by CVB3 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies a new risk factor that contributes to early onset and accelerated progression of ALS and offers opportunities for the development of novel targeted therapies.","['TAR DNA-binding protein 43', 'TDP-43']","['ribavirin', 'ribavirin']","['enteroviral infection', 'ALS', 'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'Infection', 'ALS', 'infection', 'enteroviral infection', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'infection', 'viral infection', 'infection', 'neurotoxicity', 'neuroinflammatory', 'ALS', 'inflammatory', 'infection', 'infection', 'ALS', 'motor dysfunction', 'viral infection', 'infection', 'ALS', 'neuronal damage', 'ALS', 'ALS']"

Finding the association of RNFL with disease duration and severity will help identify a novel noninvasive biomarker. Methods: The study was designed as a cross-sectional study and was conducted with a suitable proforma. We included the ALS cases based on the revised El Escorial criteria. Healthy controls were age and gender matched. We used the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) to assess the operational status of the patients. We measured RNFL thickness in the four quadrants with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and analyzed it. Results: We included 30 cases (60 eyes) and 10 healthy controls (20 eyes) having a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 49.5 (11.1) years with a median of 50 years, and a majority of them (65%) were middle aged (between 41 and 60 years). We found statistically significant differences in RNFL thicknesses between ALS patients and healthy controls. On segmental analysis, the right eye superior and nasal quadrants and the left eye superior, inferior, and nasal quadrants were significantly affected, along with a gross asymmetry found between the left and right eyes among ALS patients. There was a significant decrease in average RNFL thickness in definite ALS patients than probable ALS patients, with significantly reduced average RNFL thickness in moderate to severe ALS patients. On correlation analysis, disease duration showed a good negative correlation with bilateral average RNFL thickness, and the ALSFRS-R score demonstrated a good positive correlation with bilateral average RNFL thickness, which was statistically significant. Thus, a reduced bilateral RNFL thickness is associated with a decreased ALSFRS-R score.

The principal cycad genotoxin, methylazoxymethanol (MAM), forms reactive carbon-centered ions that alkylate nucleic acids in fetal rodent brain and, depending on the timing of systemic administration, induces persistent developmental abnormalities of the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and retina. Whereas administration of MAM prenatally or postnatally can produce animal models of epilepsy, schizophrenia or ataxia, administration to adult animals produces little effect on brain structure or function. The neurotoxic effects of MAM administered to rats during cortical brain development (specifically, gestation day 17) are used to model the histological, neurophysiological and behavioral deficits of human schizophrenia, a condition that may precede or follow clinical onset of motor neuron disease in subjects with sporadic ALS and ALS/PDC. While studies of migrants to and from communities impacted by ALS/PDC indicate the degenerative brain disorder may be acquired in juvenile and adult life, a proportion of indigenous cases shows neurodevelopmental aberrations in the cerebellum and retina consistent with MAM exposure in utero. MAM induces specific patterns of DNA damage and repair that associate with increased tau expression in primary rat neuronal cultures and with brain transcriptional changes that parallel those associated with human ALS and Alzheimer's disease. We examine MAM in relation to neurodevelopment, epigenetic modification, DNA damage/replicative stress, genomic instability, somatic mutation, cell-cycle reentry and cellular senescence.

In recent years, hydrophilic bile acids, particularly tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), have shown important anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective activities, with numerous experimental and clinical evidence suggesting their possible therapeutic use as disease-modifiers in neurodegenerative diseases. Experimental evidence on the mechanisms underlying TUDCA's neuroprotective action derives from animal models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cerebral ischemia. Preclinical studies indicate that TUDCA exerts its effects not only by regulating and inhibiting the apoptotic cascade, but also by reducing oxidative stress, protecting the mitochondria, producing an anti-neuroinflammatory action, and acting as a chemical chaperone to maintain the stability and correct folding of proteins. Furthermore, data from phase II clinical trials have shown TUDCA to be safe and a potential disease-modifier in ALS. ALS is the first neurodegenerative disease being treated with hydrophilic bile acids.

Despite the identification of more than 40 different ALS-causing mutations, the accumulation of neurotoxic misfolded proteins, inclusions, and aggregates within motor neurons is the main pathological hallmark in all cases of ALS. These protein aggregates are proposed to disrupt cellular processes and ultimately result in neurodegeneration. One of the main reasons implicated in the accumulation of protein aggregates may be defective autophagy, a highly conserved intracellular ""clearance"" system delivering misfolded proteins, aggregates, and damaged organelles to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy is one of the primary stress response mechanisms activated in highly sensitive and specialised neurons following insult to ensure their survival. The upregulation of autophagy through pharmacological autophagy-inducing agents has largely been shown to reduce intracellular protein aggregate levels and disease phenotypes in different in vitro and in vivo models of neurodegenerative diseases.

The highly conserved pathway of autophagy is particularly necessary for preventing and counteracting pathogenic insults that may lead to neurodegeneration. In line with this, mutations in genes that encode essential autophagy factors result in impaired autophagy and lead to neurodegenerative conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the mechanistic details underlying the neuroprotective role of autophagy, neuronal resistance to autophagy induction, and the neuron-specific effects of autophagy-impairing mutations remain incompletely defined. Further, the manner and extent to which non-cell autonomous effects of autophagy dysfunction contribute to ALS pathogenesis are not fully understood. Here, we review the current understanding of the interplay between autophagy and ALS pathogenesis by providing an overview of critical steps in the autophagy pathway, with special focus on pivotal factors impaired by ALS-causing mutations, their physiologic effects on autophagy in disease models, and the cell type-specific mechanisms regulating autophagy in non-neuronal cells which, when impaired, can contribute to neurodegeneration. This review thereby provides a framework not only to guide further investigations of neuronal autophagy but also to refine therapeutic strategies for ALS and related neurodegenerative diseases.Abbreviations: ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Atg: autophagy-related; CHMP2B: charged multivesicular body protein 2B; DPR: dipeptide repeat; FTD: frontotemporal dementia; iPSC: induced pluripotent stem cell; LIR: LC3-interacting region; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; PINK1: PTEN induced kinase 1; RNP: ribonuclear protein; sALS: sporadic ALS; SPHK1: sphingosine kinase 1; TARDBP/TDP-43: TAR DNA binding protein; TBK1: TANK-binding kinase 1; TFEB: transcription factor EB; ULK: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase; UPR: unfolded protein response; UPS: ubiquitin-proteasome system; VCP: valosin containing protein.","['CHMP2B', 'charged multivesicular body protein 2B', 'LIR', 'LC3', 'LC3', 'MTOR', 'PINK1', 'SPHK1', 'sphingosine kinase 1', 'TARDBP', 'TDP-43', 'TAR DNA binding protein', 'TBK1', 'TANK-binding kinase 1', 'TFEB', 'transcription factor EB', 'VCP', 'valosin containing protein']",[],"['ALS', 'neurodegeneration', 'neurodegenerative conditions', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'neurodegeneration', 'ALS', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'ALS', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'FTD', 'frontotemporal dementia', 'sALS', 'sporadic ALS']"

However, the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effect are not fully understood. The aim here was to investigate the mechanism by studying the effect of intraspinally injected NP-iPS into asymptomatic and early symptomatic superoxide dismutase (SOD)1G93A transgenic rats. Prior to transplantation, NP-iPS were characterized in vitro for their ability to differentiate into a neuronal phenotype. Motor functions were tested in all animals, and the tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and Western blot. NP-iPS transplantation significantly preserved MNs, slowed disease progression, and extended the survival of all treated animals. The dysregulation of spinal chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans was observed in SOD1G93A rats at the terminal stage. NP-iPS application led to normalized host genes expression (versican, has-1, tenascin-R, ngf, igf-1, bdnf, bax, bcl-2, and casp-3) and the protection of perineuronal nets around the preserved MNs. In the host spinal cord, transplanted cells remained as progenitors, many in contact with MNs, but they did not differentiate. The findings suggest that NP-iPS demonstrate neuroprotective properties by regulating local gene expression and regulate plasticity by modulating the central nervous system (CNS) extracellular matrix such as perineuronal nets (PNNs).","['versican', 'has-1', 'tenascin-R', 'ngf', 'igf-1', 'bdnf', 'bax', 'bcl-2', 'casp-3']",[],"['ALS', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS']"

The AGEs exert multifactorial effects on cell damage leading to the onset of neurological disorders. The interaction of AGEs with the receptors for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) contribute to the activation of intracellular signaling and the expression of the pro-inflammatory transcription factors and various inflammatory cytokines. This inflammatory signaling cascade is associated with various neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), secondary effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and diabetic neuropathy, and other AGE-related diseases, including diabetes and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the imbalance of gut microbiota and intestinal inflammation are also associated with endothelial dysfunction, disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB) and thereby the onset and progression of AD and other neurological diseases. AGEs and RAGE play an important role in altering the gut microbiota composition and thereby increase the gut permeability and affect the modulation of the immune-related cytokines. The inhibition of the AGE-RAGE interactions, through small molecule-based therapeutics, prevents the inflammatory cascade of events associated with AGE-RAGE interactions, and thereby attenuates the disease progression.

While the etiology of many neurodegenerative diseases remains elusive, several factors are thought to contribute to the neurodegenerative process, such as oxidative and nitrosative stress, excitotoxicity, endoplasmic reticulum stress, protein aggregation, and neuroinflammation. These processes culminate in the death of vulnerable neuronal populations, which manifests symptomatically as cognitive and/or motor impairments. Until recently, most treatments for these disorders have targeted single aspects of disease pathology; however, this strategy has proved largely ineffective, and focus has now turned towards therapeutics which target multiple aspects underlying neurodegeneration. Anthocyanins are unique flavonoid compounds that have been shown to modulate several of the factors contributing to neuronal death, and interest in their use as therapeutics for neurodegeneration has grown in recent years. Additionally, due to observations that the bioavailability of anthocyanins is low relative to that of their metabolites, it has been proposed that anthocyanin metabolites may play a significant part in mediating the beneficial effects of an anthocyanin-rich diet.

Mutant SOD1 mice provide a very robust mammalian model of ALS with high validity, but mutations in SOD1 account for only a small percentage of ALS cases in the clinic, with the preponderant amount of cases being sporadic and of unknown aetiology. As per other putative drugs for ALS developed and tested primarily in mutant SOD1 mice, this raises important questions about the pertinence of CuII(atsm) to broader clinical translation. This review highlights some of the challenges associated with the clinical translation of new treatment options for ALS. It then provides a brief account of pre-clinical outcomes for CuII(atsm) in SOD1 mouse models of ALS, followed by an outline of additional studies which report positive outcomes for CuII(atsm) when assessed in cell and mouse models of neurodegeneration which do not involve mutant SOD1.

Unfortunately, there are no treatments that slow or prevent disease development and progression. Regardless of the underlying cause of the disorder, age is the strongest risk factor for developing these maladies, suggesting that changes that occur in the aging brain put it at increased risk for neurodegenerative disease development. Moreover, since there are a number of different changes that occur in the aging brain, it is unlikely that targeting a single change is going to be effective for disease treatment. Thus, compounds that have multiple biological activities that can impact the various age-associated changes in the brain that contribute to neurodegenerative disease development and progression are needed.

The exact mechanisms of sporadic ALS, which comprises 90% of all cases, remain unknown. In familial ALS, mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause 10% of cases. METHODS: ALS patient-derived human-induced pluripotent stem cells (ALS hiPSCs, harboring the SOD1AV4 mutation), were differentiated to MNs (ALS-MNs). The neuroprotective effects of conditioned medium (CM) of hESCs (H9), wt hiPSCs (WTC-11) and the ALS iPSCs, on MN apoptosis and viability, formation and maintenance of neurites, mitochondrial activity and expression of inflammatory genes, were examined. For in vivo studies, 200 mul of CM from the ALS iPSCs (CS07 and CS053) was injected subcutaneously into the ALS model mice (transgenic for the human SOD1G93A mutation). Animal agility and strength, muscle innervation and mass, neurological score, onset of paralysis and lifespan of the ALS mice were assayed. After observing significant disease-modifying effects, the CM was characterized biochemically by fractionation, comparative proteomics, and epigenetic screens for the dependence on pluripotency. CM of fibroblasts that were differentiated from the wt hiPSCs lacked any neuroprotective activity and was used as a negative control throughout the studies. RESULTS: The secretome of PSCs including the ALS patient iPSCs was neuroprotective in the H2O2 model. In the model with pathogenic SOD1 mutation, ALS iPSC-CM attenuated all examined hallmarks of ALS pathology, rescued human ALS-MNs from denervation and death, restored mitochondrial health, and reduced the expression of inflammatory genes. The ALS iPSC-CM also improved neuro-muscular health and function, and delayed paralysis and morbidity in ALS mice. Compared side by side, cyclosporine (CsA), a mitochondrial membrane blocker that prevents the leakage of mitochondrial DNA, failed to avert the death of ALS-MNs, although CsA and ALS iPSC-CM equally stabilized MN mitochondria and attenuated inflammatory genes. Biochemical characterization, comparative proteomics, and epigenetic screen all suggested that it was the interactome of several key proteins from different fractions of PSC-CM that delivered the multifaceted neuroprotection.

The morbidity linked to NDs is growing, which poses a severe threat to human being's mental and physical ability to live well. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is now known to have a crucial role in the emergence of NDs. The gut microbiota is a conduit for the GBA, a two-way communication system between the gut and the brain. The myriad microorganisms that make up the gut microbiota can affect brain physiology by transmitting numerous microbial chemicals from the gut to the brain via the GBA or neurological system. The synthesis of neurotransmitters, the immunological response, and the metabolism of lipids and glucose have all been demonstrated to be impacted by alterations in the gut microbiota, such as an imbalance of helpful and harmful bacteria. In order to develop innovative interventions and clinical therapies for NDs, it is crucial to comprehend the participation of the gut microbiota in these conditions. In addition to using antibiotics and other drugs to target particular bacterial species that may be a factor in NDs, this also includes using probiotics and other fecal microbiota transplantation to maintain a healthy gut microbiota. In conclusion, the examination of the GBA can aid in understanding the etiology and development of NDs, which may benefit the improvement of clinical treatments for these disorders and ND interventions.

This study aimed to find plants with therapeutic bioactivities for a range of NDs. 1339 of the 2001 plant species were found to have a bioactivity from the literature of therapeutic relevance to NDs such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, AD, motor neurone diseases, multiple sclerosis, prion diseases, Neimann-Pick disease, glaucoma, Friedreich's ataxia and Batten disease. 43 types of bioactivities were found, such as reducing protein misfolding, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and cell death, and promoting neurogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, longevity, and anti-microbial activity. Ethno-led plant selection was more effective than random selection of plant species. Our findings indicate that ethnomedicinal plants provide a large resource of ND therapeutic potential.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a double-stranded circular molecule of ~16.5 kbp that can exist in multiple copies within the organelle. Both strands are translated and encode for 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs, and 13 proteins. mtDNA molecules are anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane and, in association with proteins, form a structure called nucleoid, which exerts a structural and protective function. Indeed, mitochondria have evolved mechanisms necessary to protect their DNA from chemical and physical lesions such as DNA repair pathways similar to those present in the nucleus. However, there are mitochondria-specific mechanisms such as rapid mtDNA turnover, fission, fusion, and mitophagy. Nevertheless, mtDNA mutations may be abundant in somatic tissue due mainly to the proximity of the mtDNA to the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system and, consequently, to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed during ATP production. In this review, we summarise the most common types of mtDNA lesions and mitochondria repair mechanisms. The second part of the review focuses on the physiological role of mtDNA damage in ageing and the effect of mtDNA mutations in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

Since oxidative stress can be strongly involved in neurodegenerative diseases, the potential use of inosine, known for its antioxidant properties, in this context deserves particular attention. The protective action of inosine treatment could be mediated by its metabolite urate. Here, we review the current preclinical and clinical studies investigating the use of inosine in AD, PD, ALS, and MS. The most important properties of inosine seem to be its antioxidant action and its ability to raise urate levels and to increase energetic resources by improving ATP availability. Inosine appears to be generally safe and well tolerated; however, the possible formation of kidney stones should be monitored, and data on its effectiveness should be further explored since, so far, they have been controversial.

Therefore new therapies are sought in which autologous stem cells are used. They are often the patient's only hope for recovery or slowing down the progress of the disease symptoms. The most important conclusions arise after analyzing the literature on the use of stem cells in neurodegenerative diseases. The effectiveness of MSC cell therapy has been confirmed in ALS and HD therapy. MSC cells slow down ALS progression and show early promising signs of efficacy. In HD, they reduced huntingtin (Htt) aggregation and stimulation of endogenous neurogenesis. MS therapy with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) inducted significant recalibration of pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory components of the immune system. iPSC cells allow for accurate PD modeling. They are patient-specific and therefore minimize the risk of immune rejection and, in long-term observation, did not form any tumors in the brain.

Over the past decade, it has become increasingly clear that dysregulated post-translational modifications of CRMP2 contribute to the pathomechanisms of diverse diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, chronic pain, and bipolar disorder. Here, we review the discovery, functions, and current putative preclinical and clinical therapeutics targeting CRMP2. These potential therapeutics include CRMP2-based peptides that inhibit protein-protein interactions and small-molecule compounds. Capitalizing on the availability of structural information, we identify druggable pockets on CRMP2 and predict binding modes for five known CRMP2-targeting compounds, setting the stage for optimization and de novo drug discovery targeting this multifunctional protein.","['CRMP2', 'CRMP2', 'CRMP2', 'CRMP2', 'CRMP2', 'CRMP2', 'CRMP2', 'CRMP2']",[],"['Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'cancer', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'chronic pain', 'bipolar disorder']"

Although the pathological mechanisms behind these diseases remain unclear, both ALS and FTD are characterized pathologically by aberrant protein aggregation and inclusion formation within neurons, which correlates with neurodegeneration. Notably, aggregation of several key proteins, including TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and tau, have been implicated in these diseases. Proteomics methods are being increasingly applied to better understand disease-related mechanisms and to identify biomarkers of disease, using model systems as well as human samples. Proteomics-based approaches offer unbiased, high-throughput, and quantitative results with numerous applications for investigating proteins of interest. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of ALS and FTD pathophysiology obtained using proteomics approaches, and we assess technical and experimental limitations. We compare findings from various mass spectrometry (MS) approaches including quantitative proteomics methods such as stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and tandem mass tagging (TMT) to approaches such as label-free quantitation (LFQ) and sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra (SWATH-MS) in studies of ALS and FTD.

Furthermore, we explore the use of MS to detect post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, of disease-relevant proteins in ALS and FTD. We also discuss upstream technologies that enable enrichment of proteins of interest, highlighting the contributions of new techniques to isolate disease-relevant protein inclusions including flow cytometric analysis of inclusions and trafficking (FloIT).

A large number of reviews have exhaustively described either the molecular or clinical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD). Conversely, reports outlining how known drugs in use for other diseases can also be effective as therapeutic agents in neurodegenerative diseases are less reported. This review focuses on the current uses of some copper(II) chelating molecules as potential drug candidates in neurodegeneration. METHODS: Starting from the well-known harmful relationships existing between the dyshomeostasis and mis-management of metals and AD onset, we surveyed the experimental work reported in the literature, which deals with the repositioning of metal-chelating drugs in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. The reviewed papers were retrieved from common literature and their selection was limited to those describing the biomolecular aspects associated with neuroprotection. In particular, we emphasized the copper(II) coordination abilities of the selected drugs. RESULTS: Copper, together with zinc and iron, are known to play a key role in regulating neuronal functions. Changes in copper homeostasis are crucial for several neurodegenerative disorders. The studies included in this review may provide an overview on the current strategies aimed at repurposing copper (II) chelating drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Starting from the exemplary case of clioquinol repurposing, we discuss the challenge and the opportunities that repurposing of other metal-chelating drugs may provide (e.g. PBT-2, metformin and cyclodipeptides) in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. CONCLUSIONS: In order to improve the success rate of drug repositioning, comprehensive studies on the molecular mechanism and therapeutic efficacy are still required. The present review upholds that drug repurposing makes significant advantages over drug discovery since repositioned drugs had already passed the safety and toxicity tests.

Neurodegenerative diseases include the widespread Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the less frequent Huntington's disease (HD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and also rare early-onset diseases linked to mutations that cause protein aggregation or loss of function in genes that maintain protein homeostasis. The difficulties in applying gene therapy approaches to tackle these diseases is drawing increasing attention to strategies that aim to inhibit cellular toxicity and restore homeostasis by intervening in cellular pathways. These include the unfolded protein response (UPR), activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a cellular affliction that is shared by these diseases. Special focus is turned to the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway of the UPR as a target for intervention. However, the complexity of the pathway and its ability to promote cell survival or death, depending on ER stress resolution, has led to some confusion in conflicting studies. Both inhibition and activation of the PERK pathway have been reported to be beneficial in disease models, although there are also some reports where they are counterproductive.

Alterations of mitochondrial function are associated with a variety of degenerative and acute diseases. As mitochondria age in cells, they gradually become inefficient and potentially toxic. Acute injury can trigger the permeability of mitochondrial membranes, which can lead to apoptosis or necrosis. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a protein widely present in cells. It can bind to RNA, regulate a variety of RNA processes, and play a role in the formation of multi-protein/RNA complexes. Thus, the normal physiological functions of TDP-43 are particularly important for cell survival. Normal TDP-43 is located in various subcellular structures including mitochondria, mitochondrial-associated membrane, RNA particles and stress granules to regulate the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial binding, mitochondrial protein translation, and mRNA transport and translation. Importantly, TDP-43 is associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease, which are characterized by abnormal phosphorylation, ubiquitination, lysis or nuclear depletion of TDP-43 in neurons and glial cells. Although the pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathy remains unknown, the presence of pathological TDP-43 inside or outside of mitochondria and the functional involvement of TDP-43 in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology, transport, and function suggest that mitochondria are associated with TDP-43-related diseases. Autophagy is a basic physiological process that maintains the homeostasis of cells, including targeted clearance of abnormally aggregated proteins and damaged organelles in the cytoplasm; therefore, it is considered protective against neurodegenerative diseases. However, the combination of abnormal TDP-43 aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insufficient autophagy can lead to a variety of aging-related pathologies. In this review, we describe the current knowledge on the associations of mitochondria with TDP-43 and the role of autophagy in the clearance of abnormally aggregated TDP-43 and dysfunctional mitochondria.

A pathological role for histone hypoacetylation and the abnormal NF-kappaB/RelA activation involving deacetylation of lysines, with the exclusion of lysine 310, has been established in ALS. Recent findings indicate that the pathological acetylation state of NF-kappaB/RelA and histone 3 (H3) occurring in the SOD1(G93A) murine model of ALS can be corrected by the synergistic combination of low doses of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-sirtuin 1 pathway activator resveratrol and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors MS-275 (entinostat) or valproate.

No cure is available for patients diagnosed with these diseases. A prominent feature of both ALS and PD is the accumulation of protein inclusions in the cytoplasm of degenerating neurons; however, the particular proteins constituting these inclusions vary: the RNA-binding proteins TDP-43 and FUS are most notable in ALS, while alpha-synuclein aggregates into Lewy bodies in PD. In both diseases, genetic causes fail to explain the occurrence of a large proportion of cases, and thus, both are considered mostly sporadic. Despite mounting evidence for a possible role of epigenetics in the occurrence and progression of ALS and PD, epigenetic mechanisms in the context of these diseases remain mostly unexplored. Here we comprehensively delineate histone post-translational modification (PTM) profiles in ALS and PD yeast proteinopathy models. Remarkably, we find distinct changes in histone modification profiles for each. We detect the most striking changes in the context of FUS aggregation: changes in several histone marks support a global decrease in gene transcription. We also detect more modest changes in histone modifications in cells overexpressing TDP-43 or alpha-synuclein.

In this process, the shift between normal physiological function and excitotoxicity is largely controlled by astrocytes since they can control the levels of glutamate on the synaptic cleft. This control is achieved through glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft and its underlying recycling through the glutamate-glutamine cycle. The molecular mechanism that triggers excitotoxicity involves alterations in glutamate and calcium metabolism, dysfunction of glutamate transporters, and malfunction of glutamate receptors, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDAR). On the other hand, excitotoxicity can be regarded as a consequence of other cellular phenomena, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, physical neuronal damage, and oxidative stress. Regardless, it is known that the excessive activation of NMDAR results in the sustained influx of calcium into neurons and leads to several deleterious consequences, including mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, impairment of calcium buffering, the release of pro-apoptotic factors, among others, that inevitably contribute to neuronal loss. A large body of evidence implicates NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity as a central mechanism in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and epilepsy. In this review article, we explore different causes and consequences of excitotoxicity, discuss the involvement of NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity and its downstream effects on several neurodegenerative disorders, and identify possible strategies to study new aspects of these diseases that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic approaches.

There is currently no effective pharmacological treatment for ALS, and the two approved drugs riluzole and edaravone have limited effects on the symptoms and only slightly prolong the life of patients. Therefore, the development of effective therapeutic strategies is of paramount importance. In this study, we investigated whether Miyako Island Bidens pilosa (MBP) can alleviate the neurological deterioration observed in a superoxide dismutase-1 G93A mutant transgenic mouse (G93A mouse) model of ALS. We orally administered 2 g/kg/day of MBP to G93A mice at the onset of symptoms of neurodegeneration (15 weeks old) until death. Treatment with MBP markedly prolonged the life of ALS model mice by approximately 20 days compared to that of vehicle-treated ALS model mice and significantly improved motor performance. MBP treatment prevented the reduction in SMI32 expression, a neuronal marker protein, and attenuated astrocyte (detected by GFAP) and microglia (detected by Iba-1) activation in the spinal cord of G93A mice at the end stage of the disease (18 weeks old). Our results indicate that MBP administered after the onset of ALS symptoms suppressed the inflammatory activation of microglia and astrocytes in the spinal cord of the G93A ALS model mice, thus improving their quality of life.

Accumulating studies have also demonstrated that exosomes with sizes ranging from 40-100 nm, released by microglia, could serve as key mediators in intercellular signaling. These exosomes, identified in terms of cellular origin in many kinds of biological fluids, exert their effects by delivering specific cargos such as proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and mRNAs. It was shown that microglial exosomes could transport to and be uptake by neurons, which may either be beneficial or instead, detrimental to CNS diseases.

In this study, we investigate the basis for therapeutic approaches to target lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) and elucidate the mechanistic role of LSD1-histone H3K4 signaling pathway in ALS pathogenesis. METHODS: In order to examine the role of spermidine (SD), we administered SD to an animal model of ALS (G93A) and performed neuropathological analysis, body weight, and survival evaluation. RESULTS: Herein, we found that LSD1 activity is increased while levels of H3K4me2, a substrate of LSD1, is decreased in cellular and animal models of ALS. SD administration modulated the LSD1 activity and restored H3K4me2 levels in ChAT-positive motor neurons in the lumbar spinal cord of ALS mice. SD prevented cellular damage by improving the number and size of motor neurons in ALS mice. SD administration also reduced GFAP-positive astrogliogenesis in the white and gray matter of the lumbar spinal cord, improving the neuropathology of ALS mice. Moreover, SD administration improved the rotarod performance and gait analysis of ALS mice. Finally, SD administration delayed disease onset and prolonged the lifespan of ALS (G93A) transgenic mice.

32825423,Int J Mol Sci,['Illes P'],P2X7 Receptors Amplify CNS Damage in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"ATP is a (co)transmitter and signaling molecule in the CNS. It acts at a multitude of ligand-gated cationic channels termed P2X to induce rapid depolarization of the cell membrane. Within this receptor-channel family, the P2X7 receptor (R) allows the transmembrane fluxes of Na+, Ca2+, and K+, but also allows the slow permeation of larger organic molecules. This is supposed to cause necrosis by excessive Ca2+ influx, as well as depletion of intracellular ions and metabolites. Cell death may also occur by apoptosis due to the activation of the caspase enzymatic cascade. Because P2X7Rs are localized in the CNS preferentially on microglia, but also at a lower density on neuroglia (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) the stimulation of this receptor leads to the release of neurodegeneration-inducing bioactive molecules such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proteases, reactive oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and the excitotoxic glutamate/ATP. Various neurodegenerative reactions of the brain/spinal cord following acute harmful events (mechanical CNS damage, ischemia, status epilepticus) or chronic neurodegenerative diseases (neuropathic pain, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) lead to a massive release of ATP via the leaky plasma membrane of neural tissue. This causes cellular damage superimposed on the original consequences of neurodegeneration. Hence, blood-brain-barrier permeable pharmacological antagonists of P2X7Rs with excellent bioavailability are possible therapeutic agents for these diseases.

We need highly efficient MN differentiation strategies for generating iPSC-derived disease models that closely recapitulate the genetic and phenotypic complexity of ALS. An important application of these models is to understand molecular mechanisms of action of FDA-approved ALS drugs that only show modest clinical efficacy. Novel mechanistic insights will help us design optimal therapeutic strategies together with predictive biomarkers to achieve better efficacy. METHODS: We induce efficient MN differentiation from iPSCs in 4 days using synthetic mRNAs coding two transcription factors (Ngn2 and Olig2) with phosphosite modification. These MNs after extensive characterization were applied in electrophysiological and neurotoxicity assays as well as transcriptomic analysis, to study the neuroprotective effect and molecular mechanisms of edaravone, an FDA-approved drug for ALS, for improving its clinical efficacy. RESULTS: We generate highly pure and functional mRNA-induced MNs (miMNs) from control and ALS iPSCs, as well as embryonic stem cells. Edaravone alleviates H2O2-induced neurotoxicity and electrophysiological dysfunction in miMNs, demonstrating its neuroprotective effect that was also found in the glutamate-induced miMN neurotoxicity model. Guided by the transcriptomic analysis, we show a previously unrecognized effect of edaravone to induce the GDNF receptor RET and the GDNF/RET neurotrophic signaling in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a clinically translatable strategy to activate this key neuroprotective signaling. Notably, edaravone can replace required neurotrophic factors (BDNF and GDNF) to support long-term miMN survival and maturation, further supporting the neurotrophic function of edaravone-activated signaling. Furthermore, we show that edaravone and GDNF combined treatment more effectively protects miMNs from H2O2-induced neurotoxicity than single treatment, suggesting a potential combination strategy for ALS treatment.

Mechanisms of their suppression rely on causing an increase in the intracellular iron content. Moreover, among the identified chemical suppressors were copper ionophores, which require a functional iron uptake system for activity, and flavonoids, which bind iron.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, and the critical pathological target needs to be identified before effective drugs can be developed for patients with ALS. Since ALS is a disease involving both motor neuron death and skeletal muscle paralysis, suitable therapy with optimal treatment effects would involve a motor neuron target combined with a skeletal muscle target. Herbal medicine is effective for complex diseases because it consists of multiple components for multiple targets. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the herbal medicine HET on motor function and survival in hSOD1G93A transgenic mice. HET was orally administered once a day for 6 weeks from the age of 2 months (the pre-symptomatic stage) of hSOD1G93A transgenic mice. We used the rota-rod test and foot printing test to examine motor activity, and Western blotting and H&E staining for evaluation of the effects of HET in the gastrocnemius muscle and lumbar (L4-5) spinal cord of mice. We found that HET treatment dramatically inhibited inflammation and oxidative stress both in the spinal cord and gastrocnemius of hSOD1G93A transgenic mice. Furthermore, HET treatment improved motor function and extended the survival of hSOD1G93A transgenic mice. Our findings suggest that HET treatment may modulate the immune reaction in muscles and neurons to delay disease progression in a model of ALS.",[],"['Hochu-ekki', '-Tang', 'BJIGT', 'H&E']","['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'respiratory disorders', 'chronic diseases', 'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'muscle paralysis', 'motor neuron disease', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'muscle paralysis', 'inflammation', 'ALS']"

Furthermore, some genes that cause FTD or ALS when mutated encode proteins that localize to the lysosome or modulate endosome-lysosome function, including lysosomal fusion, cargo trafficking, lysosomal acidification, autophagy, or TFEB activity. In this review, we summarize evidence that lysosomal dysfunction, caused by genetic mutations (e.g. C9orf72, GRN, MAPT, TMEM106B) or toxic-gain of function (e.g. aggregation of TDP-43 or tau), is an important pathogenic disease mechanism in FTD and ALS. Further studies into the normal function of many of these proteins are required and will help uncover the mechanisms that cause lysosomal dysfunction in FTD and ALS.

The high cost of approved drugs, severity of side effects, injection site pain, and restrictions on drug delivery to the Central Nervous System (CNS) can overshadow the management of these diseases. Due to the chronic and progressive evolution of neurodegenerative disorders and since there is still no cure for them, new therapeutic strategies such as the combination of several drugs or the use of existing drugs with new therapeutic applications are valuable strategies. Tetracyclines are traditionally classified as antibiotics. However, in this class of drugs, doxycycline and minocycline exhibit also anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting microglia/macrophages. Hence, they have been studied as potential agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The results of in vitro and in vivo studies confirm the effective role of these two drugs as anti-inflammatory agents in experimentally induced models of neurodegenerative diseases. In clinical studies, satisfactory results have been obtained in Multiple sclerosis (MS) but not yet in other disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), or Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In recent years, researchers have developed and evaluated nanoparticulate drug delivery systems to improve the clinical efficacy of these two tetracyclines for their potential application in neurodegenerative diseases.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) with a length of 19 to 25 nucleotides, participating in the regulation of gene expression. Different studies have demonstrated that miRNAs deregulation is critical for the onset of a considerable number of neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. Some studies have underlined how miRNAs are deregulated in ALS patients and for this reason, design therapies are used to correct the aberrant expression of miRNAs. With this rationale, delivery systems can be designed to target specific miRNAs.

One need for neuroregenerative applications is to characterize the spectrum of MSC responses to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) environment after their injection into the intrathecal space. Mechanistic understanding of cellular biology in response to the CSF environment may predict the ability of MSCs to promote injury repair or provide neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: In this study, we characterized changes in morphology, metabolism, and gene expression occurring in human adipose-derived MSCs cultured in human (hCSF) or artificial CSF (aCSF) as well as examined relevant protein levels in the CSF of subjects treated with MSCs for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that, under intrathecal-like conditions, MSCs retained their morphology, though they became quiescent. Large-scale transcriptomic analysis of MSCs revealed a distinct gene expression profile for cells cultured in aCSF. The aCSF culture environment induced expression of genes related to angiogenesis and immunomodulation. In addition, MSCs in aCSF expressed genes encoding nutritional growth factors to expression levels at or above those of control cells. Furthermore, we observed a dose-dependent increase in growth factors and immunomodulatory cytokines in CSF from subjects with ALS treated intrathecally with autologous MSCs.

However, pleiotropic association patterns among them remain poorly understood. We here analyzed 4 major neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and found suggestively positive genetic correlation. We next implemented a gene-centric pleiotropy analysis with a powerful method called PLACO and detected 280 pleiotropic associations (226 unique genes) with these diseases. Functional analyses demonstrated that these genes were enriched in the pancreas, liver, heart, blood, brain, and muscle tissues; and that 42 pleiotropic genes exhibited drug-gene interactions with 341 drugs. Using Mendelian randomization, we discovered that AD and PD can increase the risk of developing ALS, and that AD and ALS can also increase the risk of developing FTD, respectively. Overall, this study provides in-depth insights into shared genetic components and causal relationship among the 4 major neurodegenerative diseases, indicating genetic overlap and causality commonly drive their co-occurrence.

Due to the complex and multifactorial nature of the various risk factors and mechanisms that are related to motor neuronal degeneration, the pathological mechanisms of ALS are not fully understood. Oxidative stress is one of the known causes of ALS pathogenesis. This has been observed in patients as well as in cellular and animal models, and is known to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and the loss of motor neurons. Numerous therapeutic agents have been developed to inhibit oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. In this review, we describe the role of oxidative stress in ALS pathogenesis, and discuss several anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative agents as potential therapeutics for ALS.

Neurodegeneration is gradual over time, characterized by neuronal death that causes deterioration of cognitive or motor functions, ultimately leading to the patient's death. Currently, there are no treatments that effectively slow the progression of any neurodegenerative disease, but improved microscopy assays and models for neurodegeneration could lead the way to the discovery of disease-modifying therapeutics. Areas covered: Herein, the authors describe cell-based assays used to discover drugs with the potential to slow neurodegeneration, and their associated disease models. They focus on microscopy technologies that can be adapted to a high-throughput screening format that both detect cell death and monitor early signs of neurodegeneration and functional changes to identify drugs that the block early stages of neurodegeneration. Expert opinion: Many different phenotypes have been used in screens for the development of therapeutics towards neurodegenerative disease. The context of each phenotype in relation to neurodegeneration must be established to identify therapeutics likely to successfully target and treat disease. The use of improved models of neurodegeneration, statistical analyses, computational models, and improved markers of neuronal death will help in this pursuit and lead to better screening methods to identify therapeutic compounds against neurodegenerative disease.",[],[],"['neurodegenerative disease', 'Neurodegenerative diseases', 'Neurodegeneration', 'neuronal death', 'deterioration of cognitive or motor functions', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'neurodegeneration', 'neurodegeneration', 'neurodegeneration', 'neurodegeneration', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'neurodegeneration', 'neurodegeneration', 'neuronal death', 'neurodegenerative disease']"

ALS is characterized by the selective and progressive loss of motoneurons in the spinal cord, brainstem and cerebral cortex. Clinical manifestations typically occur in midlife and start with focal muscle weakness, followed by the rapid and progressive wasting of muscles and subsequent paralysis. As with other neurodegenerative diseases, the condition typically begins at an initial point and then spreads along neuroanatomical tracts. This feature of disease progression suggests the spreading of prion-like proteins called prionoids in the affected tissues, which is similar to the spread of prion observed in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Intensive research over the last decade has proposed the ALS-causing gene products Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1, TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa, and fused in sarcoma as very plausible prionoids contributing to the spread of the pathology.

However, there is no treatment, as yet, for the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) despite substantial evidence existing of the involvement of TDP-43 protein in the evolution of ALS. To circumvent this filtering effect, we have developed a novel approach to facilitate the penetration of antibody fragments (Fabs) into the brain parenchyma. Leveraging the homing properties of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), we transfected, ex vivo, such cells with vectors encoding anti-beta-amyloid and anti-TDP43 Fabs turning them into an ""antibody fragment factory"". When injected these cells integrate into the BBB, where they secrete anti-TDP43 Fabs. The results showed the formation of tight junctions between the injected engineered EPCs and the unlabeled resident endothelial cells. When the EPCs were further modified to express the anti-TDP43 Fab, we could observe integration of these cells into the vasculature and the secretion of Fabs.

Common pathogenic mechanisms in these diseases are evident, suggesting that a platform neuroprotective therapy may offer effective treatments. Here we present evidence for the mode of pharmacological action of a novel neuroprotective low molecular weight dextran sulphate drug called ILB . The working hypothesis was that ILB  acts via the activation of heparin-binding growth factors (HBGF). Methods: Pre-clinical and clinical (healthy people and patients with ALS) in vitro and in vivo studies evaluated the mode of action of ILB . In vitro binding studies, functional assays and gene expression analyses were followed by the assessment of the drug effects in an animal model of severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) using gene expression studies followed by functional analysis. Clinical data, to assess the hypothesized mode of action, are also presented from early phase clinical trials. Results: ILB  lengthened APTT time, acted as a competitive inhibitor for HGF-Glypican-3 binding, effected pulse release of heparin-binding growth factors (HBGF) into the circulation and modulated growth factor signaling pathways. Gene expression analysis demonstrated substantial similarities in the functional dysregulation induced by sTBI and various human neurodegenerative conditions and supported a cascading effect of ILB  on growth factor activation, followed by gene expression changes with profound beneficial effect on molecular and cellular functions affected by these diseases. The transcriptional signature of ILB  relevant to cell survival, inflammation, glutamate signaling, metabolism and synaptogenesis, are consistent with the activation of neuroprotective growth factors as was the ability of ILB  to elevate circulating levels of HGF in animal models and humans. Conclusion: ILB  releases, redistributes and modulates the bioactivity of HBGF that target disease compromised nervous tissues to initiate a cascade of transcriptional, metabolic and immunological effects that control glutamate toxicity, normalize tissue bioenergetics, and resolve inflammation to improve tissue function. This unique mechanism of action mobilizes and modulates naturally occurring tissue repair mechanisms to restore cellular homeostasis and function. The identified pharmacological impact of ILB  supports the potential to treat various acute and chronic neurodegenerative disease, including sTBI and ALS.",['HGF'],"['low molecular', 'dextran sulphate', 'low molecular', 'dextran sulphate', 'ILB', 'ILB', 'ILB', 'glutamate', 'glutamate', 'ILB']","['neurodegenerative diseases', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Acute', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'ALS', 'traumatic brain injury', 'sTBI', 'sTBI', 'neurodegenerative conditions', 'inflammation', 'toxicity', 'inflammation', 'acute', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'sTBI', 'ALS']"

Such an approach should promote remyelination and/or stimulate myelin repair by acting on mitochondrial function, thereby heralding a life-saving path forward for patients suffering from neuroinflammatory diseases. Disorders of myelin in the nervous system damage the transmission of signals, resulting in loss of vision, motion, sensation, and other functions depending on the affected nerves, currently with no effective treatment. Klotho genes and their single-pass transmembrane Klotho proteins are powerful governors of the threads of life and death, true to the origin of their name, Fates, in Greek mythology. Among its many important functions, Klotho is an obligatory co-receptor that binds, activates, and/or potentiates critical fibroblast growth factor activity. Since the discovery of Klotho a little over two decades ago, it has become ever more apparent that when Klotho pathways go awry, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction take over, and age-related chronic disorders are likely to follow. The physiological consequences can be wide ranging, potentially wreaking havoc on the brain, eye, kidney, muscle, and more. Central nervous system disorders, neurodegenerative in nature, and especially those affecting the myelin sheath, represent worthy targets for advancing therapies that act upon Klotho pathways. Current drugs for these diseases, even therapeutics that are disease modifying rather than treating only the symptoms, leave much room for improvement.

Learning potential lessons to improve future therapeutic approaches is the aim of this review. Two long-term, controlled trials on three anti-beta-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab and crenezumab) in subjects carrying Alzheimer's disease-linked mutated genes encoding for amyloid precursor protein or presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 failed to show cognitive or functional benefits. A major trial on tominersen, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce the production of the huntingtin protein in subjects with Huntington's disease, was prematurely interrupted because the drug failed to show higher efficacy than placebo and, at highest doses, led to worsened outcomes.

Recent preclinical evidence demonstrates that following application of focused ultrasound with microbubbles (FUS+MB), the BBB becomes reversibly accessible to compounds that normally are brain-impermeable, suggesting FUS+MB as a promising new platform for delivery of therapeutic agents into the central nervous system. As a step towards translation, small cohort clinical studies were performed demonstrating safe BBB opening in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients following FUS+MB, however improved drug delivery has not yet been achieved in human. Simultaneously, rapid progress in the human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) modeling technology allowed for development of novel Alzheimer's disease patient-derived BBB in vitro model that reacts to FUS+MB with BBB opening and can be used to answer fundamental questions of human BBB responses to FUS+MB in health and disease. This review summarizes key features of the BBB that contribute to limited drug delivery, recapitulates recent advances in the FUS+MB mediated human BBB opening in vivo and in vitro in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, and highlights potential strategies for fast-track translation of the FUS+MB to improve bioavailability of drugs to the human brain. With safe and effective application, this innovative FUS+MB technology may open new avenues for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases leading to improved clinical outcomes for patients.","['FUS', 'FUS', 'FUS', 'FUS', 'FUS', 'FUS', 'FUS', 'FUS']",[],"['Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'neurodegenerative diseases', ""Alzheimer's disease"", ""Parkinson's disease"", 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'neurodegenerative disorders', 'neurodegenerative diseases']"

M1 microglia release inflammatory mediators and induce inflammation and neurotoxicity, while M2 microglia release anti-inflammatory mediators and induce anti-inflammatory and neuroprotectivity. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is considered as a double-edged sword, performing both harmful and helpful effects in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies showed that balancing microglia M1/M2 polarization had a promising therapeutic prospect in neurodegenerative diseases.

Mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TAR, c9orf72 (chromosome 9 open reading frame 72) and VAPB genes are commonly found in ALS patients. Therefore, the mechanism of ALS development involves oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, glutamate excitotoxicity and aggregation of proteins, neuro-inflammation and defective RNA function. Cholesterol and LDL/HDL levels are also associated with ALS development. As a result, sterols could be a suitable biomarker for this ailment.

We aimed to investigate the statistical properties of several strategies for the simultaneous analysis of function and mortality in ALS clinical trials. METHODS: Based on the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) database, we simulated longitudinal patterns of functional decline, defined by the revised amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) and conditional survival time. Different treatment scenarios with varying effect sizes were simulated with follow-up ranging from 12 to 18 months. We considered the following analytical strategies: 1) Cox model; 2) linear mixed effects (LME) model; 3) omnibus test based on Cox and LME models; 4) composite time-to-6-point decrease or death; 5) combined assessment of function and survival (CAFS); and 6) test based on joint modeling framework. For each analytical strategy, we calculated the empirical power and sample size. RESULTS: Both Cox and LME models have increased false-negative rates when treatment exclusively affects either function or survival. The joint model has superior power compared to other strategies. The composite end point increases false-negative rates among all treatment scenarios. To detect a 15% reduction in ALSFRS-R decline and 34% decline in hazard with 80% power after 18 months, the Cox model requires 524 patients, the LME model 794 patients, the omnibus test 526 patients, the composite end point 1,274 patients, the CAFS 576 patients and the joint model 464 patients. CONCLUSION: Joint models have superior statistical power to analyze simultaneous effects on survival and function and may circumvent pitfalls encountered by other end points.

In animal models of these diseases, restoration of OXR1 has been shown to reduce or eliminate the deleterious effects of oxidative stress induced cell death, delay the onset of symptoms, and reduce overall severity. Moreover, increasing OXR1 expression in cells further increases oxidative stress resistance and delays onset of disease while showing no detectable side effects. Thus, restoring or increasing OXR1 function shows promise as a therapeutic for multiple neurodegenerative diseases. This review examines the role of OXR1 in oxidative stress resistance and its impact on neurodegenerative diseases.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a non-lysosomal proteolytic pathway involved in numerous normal functions of the nervous system, modulation of neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and recycling of membrane receptors or degradation of damaged and regulatory intracellular proteins. Aberrant accumulation of intracellular ubiquitin-positive inclusions has been implicated to a variety of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and Multiple Myeloma (MM). Genetic mutation in deubiquitinating enzyme could disrupt UPS and results in destructive effects on neuron survival. To date, various agents were characterized with proteasome-inhibitory potential. Proteins of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and in particular, E3 ubiquitin ligases, may be promising molecular targets for neurodegenerative drug discovery. Phytochemicals, specifically polyphenols (PPs), were reported to act as proteasome-inhibitors or may modulate the proteasome activity. PPs modify the UPS by means of accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, suppression of neuronal apoptosis, reduction of neurotoxicity, and improvement of synaptic plasticity and transmission. This is the first comprehensive review on the effect of PPs on UPS. Here, we review the recent findings describing various aspects of UPS dysregulation in neurodegenerative disorders. This review attempts to summarize the latest reports on the neuroprotective properties involved in the proper functioning of natural polyphenolic compounds with implication for targeting ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the neurodegenerative diseases. We highlight the evidence suggesting that polyphenolic compounds have a dose and disorder dependent effects in improving neurological dysfunctions, and so their mechanism of action could stimulate the UPS, induce the protein degradation or inhibit UPS and reduce protein degradation.

Many studies associate microbial dysbiosis with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Multiple sclerosis (MS), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although, an overall comparative analysis of microbes and their metabolic involvement in these diseases is still lacking. In this study, we have performed a comparative analysis of microbial composition changes occurring in these four diseases. Our research showed a high resemblance of microbial dysbiosis signatures between AD, PD, and MS. However, ALS appeared dissimilar. The most common population of microbes to show an increase belonged to the phyla, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes. Although, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the only phyla that showed a decrease in their population. The functional analysis of these dysbiotic microbes showed several potential metabolic links which can be involved in the altered microbiome-gut-brain axis in neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, the microbes with elevated populations lack pathways for synthesizing SCFA acetate and butyrate. Also, these microbes have a high capacity for producing L-glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter and precursor of GABA. Contrastingly, Tryptophan and histamine have a lower representation in the annotated genome of elevated microbes. Finally, the neuroprotective compound spermidine was less represented in elevated microbes' genomes.

Biomarkers are of two types, which in some cases are operative with each other. Fluid biomarkers, started around 2000, are generated in fluid from specific proteins/peptides and miRNAs accumulated within two extracellular fluids, either the central spinal fluid or blood plasma. The switch of these proteins/peptides and miRNAs, from free to segregated within extracellular vesicles, has induced certain advantages including higher levels within fluids and lower operative expenses. Imaging biomarkers, started around 2004, are identified in vivo upon their binding by radiolabeled molecules subsequently revealed in the brain by positron emission tomography and/or other imaging techniques. A positive point for the latter approach is the quantitation of results, but expenses are much higher. At present, both types of biomarker are being extensively employed to study Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, investigated from the presymptomatic to mature stages. In conclusion, biomarkers have revolutionized scientific and medical research and practice. Diagnosis, which is often inadequate when based on medical criteria only, has been recently improved by the multiplicity and specificity of biomarkers. Analogous results have been obtained for prognosis. In contrast, improvement of therapy has been limited or fully absent, especially for Alzheimer's in which progress has been inadequate. An urgent need at hand is therefore the progress of a new drug trial design together with patient management in clinical practice.",[],[],"['Neurodegenerative Diseases', ""Alzheimer's and other"", 'neurodegenerative diseases', ""Alzheimer's""]"

While much is still unknown, advances in other neurodegenerative diseases offer valuable insights. Indeed, it is increasingly clear that the well-recognized clinical syndromes of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal muscular atrophy and frontotemporal dementia are also each preceded by a pre-symptomatic or prodromal period of varying duration, during which the underlying disease process unfolds, with associated compensatory changes and loss of inherent system redundancy. Key insights from these diseases highlight opportunities for discovery in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The development of biomarkers reflecting amyloid and tau has led to a shift in defining Alzheimer's disease based on inferred underlying histopathology. Parkinson's disease is unique among neurodegenerative diseases in the number and diversity of non-genetic biomarkers of pre-symptomatic disease, most notably REM sleep behaviour disorder. Huntington's disease benefits from an ability to predict the likely timing of clinically manifest disease based on age and CAG-repeat length alongside reliable neuroimaging markers of atrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy clinical trials have highlighted the transformational value of early therapeutic intervention, and studies in frontotemporal dementia illustrate the differential role of biomarkers based on genotype. Similar advances in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis would transform our understanding of key events in pathogenesis, thereby dramatically accelerating progress towards disease prevention. Deciphering the biology of pre-symptomatic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis relies on a clear conceptual framework for defining the earliest stages of disease. Clinically manifest amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may emerge abruptly, especially among those who harbour genetic mutations associated with rapidly progressive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the disease may also evolve more gradually, revealing a prodromal period of mild motor impairment preceding phenoconversion to clinically manifest disease. Similarly, cognitive and behavioural impairment, when present, may emerge gradually, evolving through a prodromal period of mild cognitive impairment or mild behavioural impairment before progression to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Biomarkers are critically important to studying pre-symptomatic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and essential to efforts to intervene therapeutically before clinically manifest disease emerges. The use of non-genetic biomarkers, however, presents challenges related to counselling, informed consent, communication of results and limited protections afforded by existing legislation. Experiences from pre-symptomatic genetic testing and counselling, and the legal protections against discrimination based on genetic data, may serve as a guide. Building on what we have learned-more broadly from other pre-symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases and specifically from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis gene mutation carriers-we present a road map to early intervention, and perhaps even disease prevention, for all forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",['tau'],[],"['amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'neurodegenerative diseases', ""Alzheimer's disease"", ""Parkinson's disease"", ""Huntington's disease"", 'spinal muscular atrophy', 'frontotemporal dementia', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'amyloid', ""Alzheimer's disease"", ""Parkinson's disease"", 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'REM sleep behaviour disorder', ""Huntington's disease"", 'atrophy', 'Spinal muscular atrophy', 'frontotemporal dementia', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'motor impairment', 'cognitive and behavioural impairment', 'cognitive impairment', 'behavioural impairment', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis']"

Vitamins show their therapeutic activity in Parkinson's disease by antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, different water- and lipid-soluble vitamins have also prevented amyloid beta and tau pathology.

Although neuroinflammation serves to combat these threats and reinstate brain homeostasis, chronic inflammation can result in excessive cytokine production and cell death if the cause of inflammation remains. Overexpression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a proinflammatory cytokine with a central role in microglial activation, has been associated with neuronal excitotoxicity, synapse loss, and propagation of the inflammatory state. Thalidomide and its derivatives, termed immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs), are a class of drugs that target the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of TNF-alpha mRNA, inhibiting TNF-alpha production. Due to their multi-potent effects, several IMiDs, including thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide, have been repurposed as drug treatments for diseases such as multiple myeloma and psoriatic arthritis. Preclinical studies of currently marketed IMiDs, as well as novel IMiDs such as 3,6'-dithiothalidomide and adamantyl thalidomide derivatives, support the development of IMiDs as therapeutics for neurological disease. IMiDs have a competitive edge compared to similar anti-inflammatory drugs due to their blood-brain barrier permeability and high bioavailability, with the potential to alleviate symptoms of neurodegenerative disease and slow disease progression.

Among the challenges faced by those involved in developing therapeutic drugs for neurodegenerative diseases, the syndromes are often complex, and small animal models do not fully recapitulate the unique features of the human nervous system. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a novel technology that ideally would permit us to generate neuronal cells from individual patients, thereby eliminating the problem of species-specificity inherent when using animal models. Specific phenotypes of iPSC-derived cells may permit researchers to identify sub-types and to distinguish among unique clusters and groups. Recently, iPSCs were used for drug screening and testing for neurologic disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinocerebellar atrophy (SCA), and Zika virus infection.

This process is highly regulated and can be highly flexible through a process known as alternative splicing, which allows for several transcripts to arise from a single gene, thereby greatly increasing genetic plasticity and the diversity of proteome. Alternative splicing is particularly prevalent in neuronal cells, where the splicing patterns are continuously changing to maintain cellular homeostasis and promote neurogenesis, migration and synaptic function. The continuous changes in splicing patterns and a high demand on many cis- and trans-splicing factors contribute to the susceptibility of neuronal tissues to splicing defects. The resultant neurodegenerative diseases are a large group of disorders defined by a gradual loss of neurons and a progressive impairment in neuronal function.

Age-related dysregulation of microRNA biogenesis increases neuronal vulnerability to cellular stress and may contribute to the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. All major neurodegenerative disorders are also associated with oxidative stress, which is widely recognized as a potential target for protective therapies. Albeit often considered separately, microRNA networks and oxidative stress are inextricably entwined in neurodegenerative processes. Oxidative stress affects expression levels of multiple microRNAs and, conversely, microRNAs regulate many genes involved in an oxidative stress response. Both oxidative stress and microRNA regulatory networks also influence other processes linked to neurodegeneration, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, deregulation of proteostasis, and increased neuroinflammation, which ultimately lead to neuronal death. Modulating the levels of a relatively small number of microRNAs may therefore alleviate pathological oxidative damage and have neuroprotective activity.

Computeraided or in silico drug design methods have matured into powerful tools for reducing the number of ligands that should be screened in experimental assays. METHODS: In the present review, the authors provide a basic background about neurodegenerative diseases and in silico techniques in the drug research. Furthermore, they review the various in silico studies reported against various targets in neurodegenerative diseases, including homology modeling, molecular docking, virtual high-throughput screening, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR), hologram quantitative structure activity relationship (HQSAR), 3D pharmacophore mapping, proteochemometrics modeling (PCM), fingerprints, fragment-based drug discovery, Monte Carlo simulation, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, quantum-mechanical methods for drug design, support vector machines, and machine learning approaches. RESULTS: Detailed analysis of the recently reported case studies revealed that the majority of them use a sequential combination of ligand and structure-based virtual screening techniques, with particular focus on pharmacophore models and the docking approach. CONCLUSION: Neurodegenerative diseases have a multifactorial pathoetiological origin, so scientists have become persuaded that a multi-target therapeutic strategy aimed at the simultaneous targeting of multiple proteins (and therefore etiologies) involved in the development of a disease is recommended in future.",[],[],"['Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Neurodegenerative diseases', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'AD', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', ""Parkinson's disease"", 'PD', 'spinal cerebellar ataxias', 'spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'Neurodegenerative diseases']"

These diseases are caused by abnormally folded proteins (pathogenic prions PrPSc in prion diseases, beta-amyloids/Abeta and Tau in Alzheimer's disease, alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease) that display beta-sheet-enriched structures, propagate and accumulate in the nervous central system, and trigger neuronal death. In prion diseases, PrPSc-induced corruption of the physiological functions exerted by normal cellular prion proteins (PrPC) present at the cell surface of neurons is at the root of neuronal death. For a decade, PrPC emerges as a common cell surface receptor for other amyloids such as Abeta and alpha-synuclein, which relays, at least in part, their toxicity. In lipid-rafts of the plasma membrane, PrPC exerts a signaling function and controls a set of effectors involved in neuronal homeostasis, among which are the RhoA-associated coiled-coil containing kinases (ROCKs). Here we review (i) how PrPC controls ROCKs, (ii) how PrPC-ROCK coupling contributes to neuronal homeostasis, and (iii) how the deregulation of the PrPC-ROCK connection in amyloid-based neurodegenerative diseases triggers a loss of neuronal polarity, affects neurotransmitter-associated functions, contributes to the endoplasmic reticulum stress cascade, renders diseased neurons highly sensitive to neuroinflammation, and amplifies the production of neurotoxic amyloids.","['Abeta', 'Tau', 'alpha-synuclein', 'PrPC', 'PrPC', 'Abeta', 'alpha-synuclein', 'PrPC', 'PrPC', 'PrPC', 'PrPC']",['lipid'],"['Neuronal', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Amyloid', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'prion', ""Alzheimer's"", ""Parkinson's diseases"", 'prion diseases', ""Alzheimer's disease"", ""Parkinson's disease"", 'neuronal death', 'prion diseases', 'neuronal death', 'toxicity', 'neuronal', 'neuronal', 'amyloid', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'neuronal', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxic amyloids']"

Evidence shows that muscle may act as a molecular powerhouse, whose final signals generate in patients a progressive loss of voluntary muscle function and weakness leading to paralysis. This pathology is the result of a complex cascade of events that involves a crosstalk among motor neurons, glia, and muscles, and evolves through the action of converging toxic mechanisms. In fact, mitochondrial dysfunction, which leads to oxidative stress, is one of the mechanisms causing cell death. It is a common denominator for the two existing forms of the disease: sporadic and familial. Other factors include excitotoxicity, inflammation, and protein aggregation. Currently, there are limited cures. The only approved drug for therapy is riluzole, that modestly prolongs survival, with edaravone now waiting for new clinical trial aimed to clarify its efficacy.

Quantitative systems pharmacology models of neurodegeneration diseases may be useful tools to enhance the understanding of pharmacological intervention strategies and to reduce drug attrition rates. Due to the similarities in pathophysiological mechanisms across neurodegenerative diseases, especially at the cellular and molecular levels, we envision the possibility of structural components that are conserved across models of neurodegenerative diseases. Conserved structural submodels can be viewed as building blocks that are pieced together alongside unique disease components to construct quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) models of neurodegenerative diseases. Model parameterization would likely be different between the different types of neurodegenerative diseases as well as individual patients.

Neuroinflammation has been shown to precede neurodegeneration in several neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). No drug is yet known to delay or treat neurodegeneration. Although the etiology and potential causes of NDs remain widely indefinable, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) evidently have a crucial role in the progression of NDs. MMPs, a protein family of zinc (Zn2+)-containing endopeptidases, are pivotal agents that are involved in various biological and pathological processes in the central nervous system (CNS). The current review delineates the several emerging evidence demonstrating the effects of MMPs in the progression of NDs, wherein they regulate several processes, such as (neuro)inflammation, microglial activation, amyloid peptide degradation, blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption, dopaminergic apoptosis, and alpha-synuclein modulation, leading to neurotoxicity and neuron death.

All proteins in a cell continuously turn over, contributing to development, differentiation, and aging. Due to the multiple interactions and connections of proteostasis pathways, exposure to stress conditions may cause various types of protein damage, altering cellular homeostasis and disrupting the entire network with additional cellular stress. Furthermore, protein misfolding and/or alterations during protein synthesis results in inactive or toxic proteins, which may overload the degradation mechanisms. The maintenance of a balanced proteome, preventing the formation of impaired proteins, is accomplished by two major catabolic routes: the ubiquitin proteasomal system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosomal system. The proteostasis network is particularly important in nondividing, long-lived cells, such as neurons, as its failure is implicated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These neurological disorders share common risk factors such as aging, oxidative stress, environmental stress, and protein dysfunction, all of which alter cellular proteostasis, suggesting that general mechanisms controlling proteostasis may underlay the etiology of these diseases.

Amongst the oxidative reversible modifications, the S-glutathionylation of proteins was the first to be characterized as a post-translational modification, which primarily protects proteins from irreversible oxidation. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that S-glutathionylation plays a key role in core cell processes, particularly in mitochondria, which are the main source of reactive oxygen species. S-nitrosylation, another post-translational modification, was identified >150 years ago, but it was re-introduced as a prototype cell-signaling mechanism only recently, one that tightly regulates core processes within the cell's sub-compartments, especially in mitochondria.

The main locus of ALS is motor neurons. The success of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a motor neuron disease, has triggered a paradigm shift in developing ALS therapies. The causative genes of ALS and disease-modifying genes, including those of sporadic ALS, have been identified one after another. Thus, the freedom of target choice for gene therapy has expanded by ASO strategy, leading to new avenues for therapeutic development. Tofersen for superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) was a pioneer in developing ASO for ALS. Improving protocols and devising early interventions for the disease are vital. In this review, we updated the knowledge of causative genes in ALS. We summarized the genetic mutations identified in familial ALS and their clinical features, focusing on SOD1, fused in sarcoma (FUS), and transacting response DNA-binding protein. The frequency of the C9ORF72 mutation is low in Japan, unlike in Europe and the United States, while SOD1 and FUS are more common, indicating that the target mutations for gene therapy vary by ethnicity. A genome-wide association study has revealed disease-modifying genes, which could be the novel target of gene therapy. The current status and prospects of gene therapy development were discussed, including ethical issues. Furthermore, we discussed the potential of axonal pathology as new therapeutic targets of ALS from the perspective of early intervention, including intra-axonal transcription factors, neuromuscular junction disconnection, dysregulated local translation, abnormal protein degradation, mitochondrial pathology, impaired axonal transport, aberrant cytoskeleton, and axon branching. We simultaneously discuss important pathological states of cell bodies: persistent stress granules, disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport, and cryptic splicing. The development of gene therapy based on the elucidation of disease-modifying genes and early intervention in molecular pathology is expected to become an important therapeutic strategy in ALS.","['superoxide dismutase 1', 'SOD1', 'SOD1', 'fused in sarcoma', 'FUS', 'C9ORF72', 'SOD1', 'FUS']","['antisense oligonucleotide', 'ASO', 'ASO', 'ASO']","['amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'respiratory failure', 'ALS', 'spinal muscular atrophy', 'SMA', 'motor neuron disease', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'mitochondrial pathology', 'ALS']"

Although the most consistent pathology of ALS and ALS-FTSD is a disturbance in TAR DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) metabolism, alterations in microtubule-associated tau protein (tau) metabolism can also be observed in ALS-FTSD, most prominently as pathological phosphorylation at Thr175 (pThr175tau). pThr175 has been shown to promote exposure of the phosphatase activating domain (PAD) in the tau N-terminus with the consequent activation of GSK3beta mediated phosphorylation at Thr231 (pThr231tau) leading to pathological oligomer formation. This pathological cascade of tau phosphorylation has been observed in chronic traumatic encephalopathy with ALS (CTE-ALS) and in both in vivo and in vitro experimental paradigms, suggesting that it is of critical relevance to the pathobiology of ALS-FTSD.

Membrane lipid rafts (MLRs) are specialised plasma membrane microdomains that provide a platform for intracellular trafficking and signal transduction, particularly within neurons. Dysregulation of MLRs leads to disruption of neurotrophic signalling and excessive apoptosis which mirrors the final common pathway for neuronal death in ALS, PD and AD. Sphingomyelinase (SMase) and phospholipase (PL) enzymes process components of MLRs and therefore play central roles in MLR homeostasis and in neurotrophic signalling. We review the literature linking SMase and PL enzymes to ALS, AD and PD with particular attention to attractive therapeutic targets, where functional manipulation has been successful in preclinical studies. We propose that dysfunction of these enzymes is upstream in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and to support this we provide new evidence that ALS risk genes are enriched with genes involved in ceramide metabolism (P=0.019, OR = 2.54, Fisher exact test). Ceramide is a product of SMase action upon sphingomyelin within MLRs, and it also has a role as a second messenger in intracellular signalling pathways important for neuronal survival. Genetic risk is necessarily upstream in a late age of onset disease such as ALS.

Insoluble protein aggregates, damaged mitochondria, and stress granules, which contain RNA and protein components, are recognized and degraded by the autophagy machinery in a process known as selective autophagy. Autophagy is a highly dynamic process whose dysregulation has now been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, by numerous studies. In ALS, the autophagy process has been found deregulated in both familial and sporadic cases of the disease.

It is difficult to make early diagnosis, resulting from the insidious onset and progressive development of neurodegenerative diseases. The drugs on the market cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) effectively, which leads to unfavorable prognosis and less effective treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent demand to develop a novel detection method and therapeutic strategies.

These diseases are of unknown etiology and unfavorable prognosis, and the treatments toward them are less effective (Soto and Pritzkow, 2018). Such diseases usually develop in aged people, and early clinical manifestations are atypical, resulting in difficulty in early diagnosis.

These processes ensure efficient removal of misfolded aggregation-prone proteins and damaged organelles, such as dysfunctional mitochondria, thus allowing the maintenance of proper cellular homeostasis. Beside this, emerging evidence has pointed to their involvement in the regulation of the synaptic proteome needed to guarantee an efficient neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. Along this line, an intimate interplay between the molecular machinery regulating synaptic vesicle endocytosis and synaptic autophagy is emerging, suggesting that synaptic quality control mechanisms need to be tightly coupled to neurosecretion to secure release accuracy. Defects in autophagy and endolysosomal pathway have been associated with neuronal dysfunction and extensively reported in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis among other neurodegenerative diseases, with common features and emerging genetic bases.

Endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of oxidative phosphorylation. ROS are formed due to the inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and lead to oxidative stress that affects mitochondrial metabolism. Chronic oxidative stress contributes to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The immediate consequences of oxidative stress include lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) mutation, which induce neuronal cell death. Mitochondrial binding of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein has been identified as a contributing factor in AD. In PD and HD, respectively, alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and huntingtin (Htt) gene mutations have been reported to exacerbate the effects of oxidative stress. Similarly, abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics and the respiratory chain occur in ALS due to dysregulation of mitochondrial complexes II and IV. However, oxidative stress-induced dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases can be mitigated by the antioxidant function of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which also acts through the potassium (KATP/K+) ion channel and calcium (Ca2+) ion channels to increase glutathione (GSH) levels. The pharmacological activity of H2S is exerted by both inorganic and organic compounds. GSH, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) neutralize H2O2-induced oxidative damage in mitochondria. The main purpose of this review is to discuss specific causes and effects of mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, and how these are impacted by the antioxidant functions of H2S to support the development of advancements in neurodegenerative disease treatment.","['amyloid-beta (', 'alpha-synuclein', 'alpha-syn', 'huntingtin', 'Htt', 'superoxide dismutase', 'SOD']","['hydrogen sulfide', 'reactive oxygen species', 'ROS', 'ROS', 'lipid', 'hydrogen sulfide', 'H2S', 'glutathione', 'GSH', 'H2S', 'GSH', 'H2O2', 'H2S']","['neurodegenerative diseases', 'neurodegenerative diseases', ""Alzheimer's disease"", 'AD', ""Parkinson's disease"", 'PD', ""Huntington's disease"", 'HD', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'neuronal cell death', 'AD', 'PD', 'HD', 'ALS', 'mitochondrial complexes II and IV', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'neurodegenerative disease']"

Apoptosis is very important in developing the nervous system, nonetheless an elevated level of cell death has been observed in the case of NDs. NDs are different in terms of their neuronal vulnerability and clinical manifestations, however they have some overlapping neurodegenerative pathways. It has been demonstrated by several studies with cell lines and animal models that apoptosis has a significant contribution to make in advancing AD, ALS, HD, and PD. Numerous dying neurons were also identified in the brains of individuals with NDs and these conditions were found to be linked with substantial cell loss along with common characteristics of apoptosis including activation of caspases and cysteine-proteases, DNA fragmentation, and chromatin condensation. It has been demonstrated that several therapeutic agents including antioxidants, minocycline, GAPDH ligands, p53 inhibitors, JNK (c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase) inhibitors, glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitor, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, D2 dopamine receptor agonists, FK506, cell cycle inhibitors, statins, drugs targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and gene therapy have the potential to provide protection to neurons against apoptosis. Therefore, the use of these potential therapeutic agents might be beneficial in the treatment of NDs.

The presence of neuronal androgen receptors in the peripheral and central nervous system suggests that androgen therapy might be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. To illustrate, androgen therapy reduced inflammation, amyloid-beta deposition, and cognitive impairment in patients with AD. As well, improvements in remyelination in MS have been reported; by comparison, only variable results are observed in androgen treatment of PD. In ALS, androgen administration stimulated motoneuron recovery from progressive damage and regenerated both axons and dendrites.

Moreover, the existence of the blood-brain barrier is an impediment to the penetration of exogenous molecules, including those found in many drugs. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted by a wide variety of cells, and their primary functions include intercellular communication, immune responses, human reproduction, and synaptic plasticity. Due to their natural origin and molecular similarities with most cell types, exosomes have emerged as promising therapeutic tools for numerous diseases. Specifically, neurodegenerative diseases have shown to be a potential target for this nanomedicine strategy due to the difficult access to the brain and the strategy's pathophysiological complexity. In this regard, this review explores the most important biological-origin drug delivery systems, innovative isolation methods of exosomes, their physicochemical characterization, drug loading, cutting-edge functionalization strategies to target them within the brain, the latest research studies in neurodegenerative diseases, and the future challenges of exosomes as nanomedicine-based therapeutic tools.",[],[],"['Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'Neurodegenerative diseases', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'neurodegenerative diseases']"

Cells adapted to ER stress through the activation of an integrated signal transduction pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by degeneration of the motor system. It has largely been known that ER stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ALS through the dysregulation of proteostasis. Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that ER stress and UPR are important players in TDP-43 pathology. In this mini-review, the complex interplay between ER stress and the UPR in ALS and TDP-43 pathology will be explored by taking into account the studies from in vitro and in vivo models of ALS. We also discuss therapeutic strategies to control levels of ER stress and UPR signaling components that have contrasting effects on ALS pathogenesis.","['TDP-43', 'TDP-43']",[],"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'degeneration of the motor system', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS']"
35883693,Cells,"['Wang YT', 'Lu JH']",Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Molecular Mechanisms and Pharmacological Opportunities.,"Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a protein degradation mechanism through lysosomes. By targeting the KFERQ motif of the substrate, CMA is responsible for the degradation of about 30% of cytosolic proteins, including a series of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). The fact that decreased activity of CMA is observed in NDs, and ND-associated mutant proteins, including alpha-synuclein and Tau, directly impair CMA activity reveals a possible vicious cycle of CMA impairment and pathogenic protein accumulation in ND development. Given the intrinsic connection between CMA dysfunction and ND, enhancement of CMA has been regarded as a strategy to counteract ND. Indeed, genetic and pharmacological approaches to modulate CMA have been shown to promote the degradation of ND-associated proteins and alleviate ND phenotypes in multiple ND models. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the mechanism of CMA with a focus on its relationship with NDs and discusses the therapeutic potential of CMA modulation for ND.","['alpha-synuclein', 'Tau']",[],"['Neurodegenerative Diseases', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'NDs', 'NDs', 'ND', 'ND', 'CMA dysfunction', 'ND', 'ND', 'ND', 'ND', 'ND', 'NDs', 'ND']"

These tasks based on walking analysis stand out compared to other methods due to their simplicity and non-invasiveness. This study has emerged to realize an artificial intelligence-based disease detection and severity prediction system for neurodegenerative diseases using gait features obtained from gait signals. For the detection of the disease, the problem is divided into parts which are subgroups of 4 classes consisting of Parkinson's, Huntington's, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis diseases, and the control group. In addition, the disease vs. control subgroup where all diseases are collected under a single label, the subgroups where each disease is separately against the control group. For disease severity grading, each disease was divided into subgroups and a solution was sought for the prediction problem mentioned by various machine and deep learning methods separately for each group. In this context, the resulting detection performance was measured by the metrics of Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, and Recall while the resulting prediction performance was measured by the metrics such as R, R2, MAE, MedAE, MSE, and RMSE.",[],[],"['Neurodegenerative diseases', 'neurodegenerative diseases', ""Parkinson's disease"", ""Huntington's disease"", 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'neurodegenerative diseases', ""Parkinson's"", ""Huntington's"", 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis diseases']"

This loss of motor neurons causes progressive weakness and amyotrophy. To date, the median duration of survival in patients with ALS, from first symptoms to death, is estimated to be 36 months. Currently the treatment is limited to two options: riluzole which prolongs survival for a few months and edaravone which is available in only a few countries and also has a small impact on disease progression. There is an urgent need for more effective drugs in this disease to significantly improve progression. Over the last 30 years, all trials have failed to find a curative drug for ALS. This is due, partially, to the heterogeneity of the clinical features and the pathophysiology of motor neuron death. We present in this review the various treatment options currently being developed for ALS, with an emphasis on the range of therapeutic approaches being explored, from old drugs tested in a new indication to innovative drugs obtained via biotechnology or gene therapy.",[],"['riluzole', 'edaravone']","['ALS', 'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'death', 'weakness', 'amyotrophy', 'ALS', 'death', 'ALS', 'motor neuron death', 'ALS']"

ALS has a diverse genetic origin; at least 20 genes have been shown to be related to ALS. Most familial and sporadic cases of ALS are caused by variants of the SOD1, C9orf72, FUS, and TARDBP genes. Genome editing using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated system 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) can provide insights into the underlying genetics and pathophysiology of ALS. By correcting common mutations associated with ALS in animal models and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to verify the effects of ALS-associated mutations and observe phenotype differences between patient-derived and gene-corrected iPSCs. This technology has also been used to create mutations to investigate the pathophysiology of ALS. Here, we review recent studies that have used CRISPR/Cas9 to understand the genetic underpinnings of ALS.","['SOD1', 'C9orf72', 'FUS', 'TARDBP']",[],"['ALS', 'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'ALS', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS', 'ALS']"
