The physical and chemical properties of various materials have been explored to develop natural, synthetic, or semi-synthetic materials with distinct advantages for use as drug delivery systems for the central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS diseases. In this review, an overview of popular biomaterials as drug delivery systems for neurogenerative diseases is provided, balancing the potential and challenges associated with the CNS drug delivery. As an effective drug delivery system, desired properties of biomaterials are discussed, addressing the persistent challenges such as targeted drug delivery, stimuli responsiveness, and controlled drug release in vivo. Finally, we discuss the prospects and limitations of incorporating extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a drug delivery system and their use for biocompatible, stable, and targeted delivery with limited immunogenicity, as well as their ability to be delivered via a non-invasive approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "4", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001750", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D001750"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D001750", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Urinary Bladder Neurogenic", "accession": "@DISEASE_Urinary_Bladder_Neurogenic"}, "text": "neurogenerative diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 627, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "5", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019636", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D019636"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D019636", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neurodegenerative_Diseases"}, "text": "neurodegenerative diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 1265, "length": 26}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 33375558, "pmcid": null, "meta": {}, "date": "2020-12-25T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Int J Mol Sci", "authors": ["Kumar A", "Zhou L", "Zhi K", "Raji B", "Pernell S", "Tadrous E", "Kodidela S", "Nookala A", "Kochat H", "Kumar S"], "relations_display": []}
