In this context, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively studied because of their implication in several disorders related to the central nervous system, as well as for their potential role as biomarkers of diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment. Recent studies in the field of neurodegeneration reported evidence that drug response and efficacy can be modulated by miRNA-mediated mechanisms. In fact, miRNAs seem to regulate the expression of pharmacology target genes, while approved (conventional and non-conventional) therapies can restore altered miRNAs observed in NDDs. The knowledge of miRNA pharmacoepigenomics may offers new clues to develop more effective treatments by providing novel insights into interindividual variability in drug disposition and response. Recently, the therapeutic potential of miRNAs is gaining increasing attention, and miRNA-based drugs (for cancer) have been under observation in clinical trials. However, the effective use of miRNAs as therapeutic target still needs to be investigated. Here, we report a brief review of representative studies in which miRNAs related to therapeutic effects have been investigated in NDDs, providing exciting potential prospects of miRNAs in pharmacoepigenomics and translational medicine.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019636", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D019636"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D019636", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neurodegenerative_Diseases"}, "text": "neurodegenerative diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 190, "length": 26}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019636", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D019636"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D019636", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neurodegenerative_Diseases"}, "text": "NDDs", "locations": [{"offset": 218, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019636", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D019636"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D019636", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neurodegenerative_Diseases"}, "text": "neurodegeneration", "locations": [{"offset": 583, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019636", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D019636"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D019636", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neurodegenerative_Diseases"}, "text": "NDDs", "locations": [{"offset": 876, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009369", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D009369"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D009369", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neoplasms", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neoplasms"}, "text": "cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 1184, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019636", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D019636"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D019636", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neurodegenerative_Diseases"}, "text": "NDDs", "locations": [{"offset": 1461, "length": 4}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 31892254, "pmcid": null, "meta": {}, "date": "2019-12-27T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Cells", "authors": ["Nuzziello N", "Ciaccia L", "Liguori M"], "relations_display": []}
