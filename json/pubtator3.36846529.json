These tasks based on walking analysis stand out compared to other methods due to their simplicity and non-invasiveness. This study has emerged to realize an artificial intelligence-based disease detection and severity prediction system for neurodegenerative diseases using gait features obtained from gait signals. For the detection of the disease, the problem is divided into parts which are subgroups of 4 classes consisting of Parkinson's, Huntington's, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis diseases, and the control group. In addition, the disease vs. control subgroup where all diseases are collected under a single label, the subgroups where each disease is separately against the control group. For disease severity grading, each disease was divided into subgroups and a solution was sought for the prediction problem mentioned by various machine and deep learning methods separately for each group. In this context, the resulting detection performance was measured by the metrics of Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, and Recall while the resulting prediction performance was measured by the metrics such as R, R2, MAE, MedAE, MSE, and RMSE.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019636", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D019636"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D019636", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neurodegenerative_Diseases"}, "text": "neurodegenerative diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 83, "length": 26}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D010300", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D010300"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D010300", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Parkinson Disease", "accession": "@DISEASE_Parkinson_Disease"}, "text": "Parkinson's disease", "locations": [{"offset": 118, "length": 19}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006816", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D006816"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D006816", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Huntington Disease", "accession": "@DISEASE_Huntington_Disease"}, "text": "Huntington's disease", "locations": [{"offset": 139, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000690", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D000690"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D000690", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "accession": "@DISEASE_Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis"}, "text": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "locations": [{"offset": 161, "length": 29}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019636", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D019636"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D019636", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neurodegenerative_Diseases"}, "text": "neurodegenerative diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 505, "length": 26}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D010300", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D010300"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D010300", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Parkinson Disease", "accession": "@DISEASE_Parkinson_Disease"}, "text": "Parkinson's", "locations": [{"offset": 695, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006816", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D006816"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D006816", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Huntington Disease", "accession": "@DISEASE_Huntington_Disease"}, "text": "Huntington's", "locations": [{"offset": 708, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000690", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D000690"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D000690", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "accession": "@DISEASE_Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis"}, "text": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 722, "length": 38}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 36846529, "pmcid": null, "meta": {}, "date": "2023-02-18T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Multimed Tools Appl", "authors": ["Erda\u015f \u00c7B", "S\u00fcmer E", "Kibaro\u011flu S"], "relations_display": []}
