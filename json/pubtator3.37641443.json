However, few successes have been observed with only modest effects. Along with an improved but incomplete understanding of ALS as a neurodegenerative disease is the evolution of more sophisticated and diverse in vitro and in vivo preclinical modeling platforms, as well as clinical trial designs. We highlight proposed pathological pathways that have been major therapeutic targets for investigational compounds. It is likely that the failures of so many of these therapeutic compounds may not have occurred because of lack of efficacy but rather because of a lack of preclinical modeling that would help define an appropriate disease pathway, as well as a failure to establish target engagement. These challenges are compounded by shortcomings in clinical trial design, including lack of biomarkers that could predict clinical success and studies that are underpowered. Although research investments have provided abundant insights into new ALS-relevant pathways, most have not yet been developed more fully to result in clinical study. In this review, we detail some of the important, well-established pathways, the therapeutics targeting them, and the subsequent clinical design. With an understanding of some of the shortcomings in translational efforts over the last three decades of ALS investigation, we propose that scientists and clinicians may choose to revisit some of these therapeutic pathways reviewed here with an eye toward improving preclinical modeling, biomarker development, and the investment in more sophisticated clinical trial designs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000690", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D000690"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D000690", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "accession": "@DISEASE_Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis"}, "text": "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "locations": [{"offset": 92, "length": 29}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000690", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D000690"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D000690", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "accession": "@DISEASE_Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis"}, "text": "ALS", "locations": [{"offset": 123, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000690", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D000690"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D000690", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "accession": "@DISEASE_Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis"}, "text": "ALS", "locations": [{"offset": 366, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019636", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D019636"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D019636", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neurodegenerative_Diseases"}, "text": "neurodegenerative disease", "locations": [{"offset": 375, "length": 25}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000690", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D000690"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D000690", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "accession": "@DISEASE_Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis"}, "text": "ALS", "locations": [{"offset": 1185, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000690", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D000690"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D000690", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "accession": "@DISEASE_Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis"}, "text": "ALS", "locations": [{"offset": 1532, "length": 3}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 37641443, "pmcid": null, "meta": {}, "date": "2023-08-28T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Ann Clin Transl Neurol", "authors": ["Maragakis NJ", "de Carvalho M", "Weiss MD"], "relations_display": []}
