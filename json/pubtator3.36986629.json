While the development of this therapy is still in the preclinical stage, it offers promising advantages over traditional routes of drug delivery. In this paper, we describe the rationale of this system and provide a technical report on the mechanism of action, that relies on the use of nanoporous membranes enabling selective molecular permeability. On one side, the membranes do not permit the crossing of certain drugs; whereas, on the other side, they permit the crossing of target molecules present in the CSF. Target molecules, by binding drugs inside the system, are retained or cleaved and subsequently eliminated from the central nervous system. Finally, we provide a list of potential indications, the respective molecular targets, and the proposed therapeutic agents.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019636", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D019636"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D019636", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neurodegenerative_Diseases"}, "text": "neurodegenerative diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 215, "length": 26}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 36986629, "pmcid": null, "meta": {}, "date": "2023-02-25T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Pharmaceutics", "authors": ["Manuel MG", "Tamba BI", "Leclere M", "Mabrouk M", "Schreiner TG", "Ciobanu R", "Cristina TZ"], "relations_display": []}
