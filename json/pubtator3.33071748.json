During the past decades, several studies have demonstrated the potential of AAV-based gene therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. While some clinical studies have failed to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy, the use of AAV as a delivery tool has demonstrated to be safe. Here, we discuss the past, current and future perspectives of gene therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. We also discuss the current advances on the newly emerging RNAi-based gene therapies which has been widely studied in preclinical model and recently also made it to the clinic.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "6", "infons": {"type": "Species", "valid": false, "normalized_id": null, "biotype": "species"}, "text": "AAV", "locations": [{"offset": 297, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019636", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D019636"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D019636", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neurodegenerative_Diseases"}, "text": "neurodegenerative diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 343, "length": 26}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"type": "Species", "valid": false, "normalized_id": null, "biotype": "species"}, "text": "AAV", "locations": [{"offset": 459, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D019636", "type": "Disease", "valid": true, "normalized": ["D019636"], "database": "ncbi_mesh", "normalized_id": "D019636", "biotype": "disease", "name": "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "accession": "@DISEASE_Neurodegenerative_Diseases"}, "text": "neurodegenerative diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 592, "length": 26}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 33071748, "pmcid": null, "meta": {}, "date": "2020-09-18T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Front Neurosci", "authors": ["Martier R", "Konstantinova P"], "relations_display": []}
